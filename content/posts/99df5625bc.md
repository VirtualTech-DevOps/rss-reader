What My project Does:
=====================

Scrapes data from sites and uses AI to extract structured data from it.

Whats New:
==========

*   BREAKING CHANGE: --pricing cli option now takes a string value of 'details', 'cost', or 'none'.
*   Added pool of user agents that gets randomly pulled from.
*   Updating pricing data.
*   Pricing token capture and compute now much more accurate.
*   Faster startup

Key Features:
=============

*   Uses Playwright / Selenium to bypass most simple bot checks.
*   Uses AI to extract data from a page and save it various formats such as CSV, XLSX, JSON, Markdown.
*   Has rich console output to display data right in your terminal.

GitHub and PyPI
===============

*   PAR Scrape is under active development and getting new features all the time.
