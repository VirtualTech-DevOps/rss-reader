I have an alias set to change "docker" to "DOCKER\_DEFAULT\_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker-compose build" from a year ago when I was working a lot with docker.

I dont want that alias to exist anymore. but I cant find it.

I posted my initial help ticket in [r/bash](/r/bash) yesterday, whose comments I reference below. here is the post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/1g2yth1/comment/lrsolob/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/1g2yth1/comment/lrsolob/?context=3)

Here is what i've done to find and diagnose the issue:

1.  tried all terminal searches recommended by the brilliant minds of this sub (thank you all, seriously)

1a. tried every other possible search technique recommended by chatgpt (desperate, learned a lot)

1.  disabled all potential 3rd party app culprits
    
2.  booted into safe mode (this stopped the text replacement)
    
3.  created and used a new user account on my mac (this also stopped the text replacement)
    
4.  checked in system settings -> keyboard -> text replacement (obviously, not in there.)
    
5.  tried using keyboard maestro (my normal text replacement strategy) to cancel it with the inverse replacement, which didn't work, because my system seems to be pasting it instead of typing the string, so KM doesn't recognize the trigger string
    

that tells me that the action lives somewhere in my main users home folder. What I don't understand, is why the search term "docker" or "DOCKER\_DEFAULT\_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker-compose build" return no results. I have no listed aliases other than the main two that boot with macOS (run-help=man which-command=whence)

I am beginning to think this is an issue compounded from macOS software updates since I set it up. how is it possible that there is no executable file or defined alias that returns the culprit, but the text replacement still works? I can hardly get it to work under ideal conditions!

seriously spinning my head at this one. if there are any wizards out there who can help me tackle this issue, I will be forever grateful.
