I want to customize how zsh completions look and feel. I really like the style I saw in one of tsoding’s streams with his emacs setup and was finally able to trace it back to the tool “ido”.

There a prompt with completion may look like: “text to comple{complete | completionize | … }”

Is there any way I could configure zsh to show completion items in this way instead of the default list view?
