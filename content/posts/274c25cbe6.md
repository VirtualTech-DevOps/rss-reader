Hi fellow denizens of the amazing text-box,

I'm the lead developer and maintainer of Zellij - a terminal workspace that does not sacrifice simplicity for power. And I'm here to share the latest release that's hot off the presses. This release includes lots of new cool stuff. Some highlights:  
1\. A non-colliding keybinding preset for those of us who were plagued by Zellij overriding certain keys they use in the terminal (eg. \`Ctrl o\` for vim's jumplist)  
2\. Configuration live reloading  
3\. A new plugin manager  
4\. A new Configuration screen to rebind leader keys  
5\. Support for multiple modifiers

And really, loads more. Check out the official announcement (where you can also see a screencast of me walking you through some of these new features): [https://zellij.dev/news/colliding-keybinds-plugin-manager/](https://zellij.dev/news/colliding-keybinds-plugin-manager/)  
And also the full release notes: [https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/tag/v0.41.0](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/tag/v0.41.0)

Happy hacking and I hope you enjoy!
