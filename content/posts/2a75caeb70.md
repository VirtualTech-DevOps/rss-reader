I've been pondering this idea about creating a random chat app like Omegle but one that only supports text chats in the terminal. Have anyone else thought about it? I feel like it would be a fun app to meet random terminal enthusiasts. But at the same time, I don't know if it would be an easier target for people making annoying bots. Just looking to ideate on this if anyone has ever thought about or tried this before.
