I want to take an image that is too wide to work as a wallpaper for my monitor (ie: a 32:9 wallpaper while I'm using my 21:9 monitor, or a 21:9 or 32:9 wallpaper while I'm using my laptop with no external monitor) and cut it into 10 equally spaced slices to show on my 10 workspaces, I'm hoping to get the same effect as on my android phone, where as I swipe to the right, it pans to the right on my background image.

A more concrete example, if I have a 5120x1440 image, and I'm using my 3440X1440 monitor, I want to create 10 horizontally cropped slices of the image. 1st going from 0-3440, 2nd going from 168-3608, 3rd going from 336-3773, etc incrementing by 168 each time (168 comes from (width of the original image - goal width)/number of workspaces, so (5120-3440)/10).

I can work out on my own how to script everthing else to work, what I need to figure out is how to make a script: 1. check the resolution of whatever next wallpaper it picks 2. if necessary create the image slices for each workspace

Is there a simpler tool to do that or should I just learn Imagemagick? I'm under the impression that imagemagick is in the same tier as ffmpeg as far as power and complexity, is this true or am I just avoiding it for nothing?
