Looking for recommendations for keys for completion (both shell and vim) and for leaders tmux/vim (feel free to substitute your favorite terminal multiplexer or editor). Besides these, more specific examples include a key for e.g. [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and for multi-selecting in fzf.

I'm using vi-mode in the shell, but ideally they don't replace frequently used keys (e.g. because Readline is is ubiquitous and its Ctrl-a being useful, it doesn't seem to be a good recommendation to use as a Tmux leader key even though it's popular because it's comfortable). I'm not fully ruling it out for rebinding though, just looking for options.

I'm using Ctrl-ESC mod-tap which I would consider essential on a standard qwerty keyboard. I'm also using a tiling window manager so the Super key is already reserved. I'm wondering if certain keys like Ctrl-m or Alt off-limits for rebinding since they seem to have "special" behaviors in a terminal? E.g. Ctrl-m triggers Enter.

*   I assume people use Tab for completions but completions is too frequent and I'm wondering if reserving Tab for something less frequent is better.
    
*   Ctrl-n/Ctrl-p isn't _awful_ for next/previous (e.g. in navigating in completions or list), but Ctrl-j/Ctrl-k feels more natural even if it's not standard in vim (I think the Ctrl-j/Ctrl-k aren't bound to a frequent action either). But `hjkl` tends to be reserved for directional window/pane focus in different layers (vim, tmux, tiling window manager).
    
*   Not sure if [tmux-vim-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) is a good plugin to use because blurring interaction between vim windows and tmux panes doesn't seem like a good idea even if binding-wise it might be convenient. Does it come naturally in all interactions?
    

Currently I have Ctrl-Space as tmux leader, Space as leader for vim. I also have Ctrl-Space for zsh-autosuggestions which needs a rebinding because it requires an additional space since it conflicts with tmux leader. I have Tab to trigger completion for zsh, and both Tab/Shift+Tab and Ctrl-j/Ctrl-k to go to next/previous as well as Ctrl-n/Ctrl-p). I should stick with only one of them and assign the rest for other functions, since none of them are _terrible_ bindings (again, my only issue with Tab is that it's been assigned for completion which is too frequent of an action, being applicable in the shell, fzf, and in the editor.

Any ideas are much appreciated.
