I am writing a script that runs in a terminal and that at some point requires spawning a new terminal window.

Most terminals us the `-e` flag for that, e.g.

    xfce-terminal -e neofetch 

So far I have found the exceptions of gnome-terminal (that uses the `--` flag), and kitty, that uses no flag.

Also, I have tested other terminals (namely mate-terminal, xterm, konsole, deepin-terminal, lxterminal, tilix, terminator, terminology), they all use the `-e` flag as well.

I am not concerned about drop-down terminals like yekuake, guake, tilda, as they would not be helpful in my case.

It would be helpful if anyone that uses another terminal (for instance foot, or any other), let me know of any other different flag that should be used, in order for the script to be compatible with all terminals.

Thanks in advance.
