Use Case:  
I have an account with a tilde server. Awesome. I am not always in a position where i can SSH into my account to update my blog.

What I want to do is send an email to tht server account.  
If the sender address and subject does not match. do nothing.

If the sender address/subject line does match do the following:  
create a txt file with the current time stamp in a specific folder (/$HOME/blog/ as example destination.)

There are steps beyond this to not just create the .gmi file but to edit two other files to add that entry to the list, but those are i feel comparitively easy.

I have no idea what i'm doing and both want to do this myself, but I'm... kinda clueless and terrified.
