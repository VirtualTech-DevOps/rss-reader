[mechvibes](http://mechvibes.com) and [rustyvibes](https://github.com/KunalBagaria/rustyvibes/issues) has issues running on wayland, but I wanted it to run on my setup, so I made wayvibes(in C++). It uses evdev and minaudio to play soundpacks which are compatible with mechvibes soundpack format. I haven't tested it much (so still WIP) but it gets the job done, atleast on my machine.
