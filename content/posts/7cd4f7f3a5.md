Hello to everyone

I don't know if this is the right sub for this question, but I saw other post about this cmdline app here so I guess it's okay.

So I've been using Yewtube for a while and I haven't gotten to play videos on higher resolution than 640x360.

I have set 2160p as the max\_res on the config file, but it seems it doesn't apply or something.

Has anyone experienced this too? Other cmdline programs, like piped-youtube, work and play with the highest resolution.
