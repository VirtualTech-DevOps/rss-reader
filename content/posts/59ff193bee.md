[tui-network](https://github.com/Zatfer17/tui-network) is a Python based TUI for managing the wifi on Linux built with [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual). And you can read [classic fortune quotes](https://wiki.debian.org/fortune) on the side, while waiting for the list of networks to refresh.

I've recently started using [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) on a DE-less Debian install as my main driver and I'm trying to keep it as minimal as possible, getting the most out of the terminal. While I like the simplicity and effectiveness of [nmtui](https://man.archlinux.org/man/nmtui.1), I find it really ugly, so I decided to make my own in Python with Textual.
