A lot of unix power users live mostly or entirely (besides the browser) in the terminal, powering their whole workflow with it. But how exactly? If you use multiple TUIs, like a file manager, process manager, and text editing, how do you switch between all of those, and the apps on your desktop? Is each TUI open in individual terminal tabs? Do you use hotkeys to open specific terminal tabs or TUI?
