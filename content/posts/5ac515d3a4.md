(Apologies if this has been asked here before, obvs tried searching the question on duckduck, reddit & stackexchange but you can see why any question on "rename", "bin", "edit", "replace" etc would yield millions of irrelevant results.)

I'm just wondering if there's a catch, like some binary files referencing the original names of each other, which would cause me to lose functionality if I renamed them.

Feels like it would be really fun to use the terminal with custom commands.
