i m trying to compose a multipart/related mail from inside neomutt (i m running a version from 2019 on ubuntu 20.04 because that was the latest from the apt repository).

according to the manual i should be able to run the two functions <group-related> (with %) and <edit-content-id> (with alt + i) inside COMPOSE.

but none of them work and if i try to bind them in the neomuttrc it is not recognising the commands. I can't find any further information on those command rather then a short paragraph in the manual where it says "use them"

my only guess is that this was implemented later than my version. but i also cant find information about when this was introduced.

the follow up question would be, how dangerous is it to remove my current neomutt install and compile the newest version from source? i have never installed something from source before. thanks!
