I've had Norton Security, now Norton Livelock or something, for years. I saw Norton 360 in the programs and features list.

And now, I'm not getting rid of Norton. I'm fine with it. No, it doesn't bog my machine down. I haven't seen that since XP. Yes, they're annoying with their stupid advertisements in the past few years. I know... You don't like Norton. Get rid of it. It's so bloated, yadda, yadda, yadda. That's not the question though. Save your typing on that stuff. Or, I'll do it -- "Get rid of Norton. That's no good/so bloated/slows your machine down. Use Defender instead. Actually... You don't need an antivirus anymore. Windows Defender is pretty good and just be careful where you go." I don't care. I've had no issues with Norton for years, like having something specific for virus (traditional or "next generation/super deluxe" behavior protection monitoring), and I've already bought another $15 subscription for another year.

Upgrades happen in the fall. My previous version of Norton 360 upgraded quietly in the background. A few days ago, I opened it and the interface was different. I have a script in a batch file that was running this line....

C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norton Security\\Engine\\versionnumber\\uistub.exe /lu

And I used a FOR loop to get around the changing versions numbers. If uistub.exe existed in any folder under that engine folder, then it ran uistube.exe /lu. Didn't have to think about version numbers or updating the script anymore after that.

Now, Norton lives in C:\\Program Files, so it's 64-bit now apparently. Filenames and folder structures are different. There's no uistub.exe file. I haven't found any /lu live update switch. (Interesting enough, when I was searching for that, I did get a /help option which stated Avast in the command line info. I was wondering if Norton was using Avast for antivirus or something now. It did literally say Avast. Maybe businesses merged. Who knows?)

Is there any way to force a live update on Norton 360 via command line, so with a batch file? I remember finding that uistube.exe /lu line took some googling before. It wasn't like Norton was emphasizing that option at all.

I just like to have it updated when I start the computer each day. It's also a reminder each time I use the computer about virus. I have the same with Windows updates. Sign in, it checks for updates (and Norton updates its live updates, or used to).

And for the linux comments.... "Just use Linux. Just use GREP/GAWK, whatever." No. I already have all my stuff. I'm just looking for a way to script live updates on Norton software.
