Hey everyone,

I'm a software developer, and for my first post here, I’d like to share a file-sharing tool I built. This tool allows you to securely share files via the command line (CLI) with **end-to-end encryption** (E2EE). It works with **bash** (Linux, macOS) and **PowerShell** (Windows). It’s completely free, no account is required, files are automatically deleted after 24 hours, and the maximum file size is 1GB.

Here’s the link to the tool: [https://rstream.io/tools/file-sharing](https://rstream.io/tools/file-sharing)

The tool compresses the data, generates a unique encryption key, encrypts the data, uploads it to S3 object storage, and provides a download link. Anyone with the link can download the data, but the encryption key is encoded in the URL fragment, meaning it's **never shared with the server**. Decryption happens directly in the browser using **Web Crypto APIs**, making the process seamless for the user.

The tool is still in its early stages, and I’m really open to feedback on its usage and any suggestions for improvement. I plan to maintain and improve it over time. Personally, I find it useful for transferring files between servers, embedded devices, homelabs, and more.

I designed the script to be as portable as possible (with minimal dependencies), simple to use, and secure (true E2E encryption).

Feel free to give it a try, and let me know what you think!
