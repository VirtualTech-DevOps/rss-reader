Hi, is there a command line that allows me to batch convert a list of say 4000 lines of short links in a text .txt file to it's real long URLs?

For example I want to convert "[https://vt.tiktok.com/xxxxxx](https://vt.tiktok.com/xxxxxx)" to its long form real URL "[https://tiktok.com/@video/thisIsTheRealVideoID](https://tiktok.com/@video/thisIsTheRealVideoID)"

Anything for Mac terminal, Windows cmd or Linux shell will be fine.
