For a long time, I've used [`fmt(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/fmt.1) to reformat emails, but it has the unfortunate aspect that it doesn't respect leading markers such as email `>` indentation.

So I've been kicking the tires on [`par(1)`](http://www.nicemice.net/par/) which does similar reformatting, but does seem to respect my emails' quoted blocks. However, I use two spaces at the end of sentences so that `vi`/`vim` can navigate by sentence without getting tripped up by mid-sentence punctuation like

> I saw Dr.␣Smith on Elm St.␣Tuesday afternoon.␣␣Her new dog was adorable!

With two spaces after sentences (and `:help cpo-J` in `vim`) and only one space after inline-punctuation (after "Dr." and "St."), the sentence-navigation `(` and `)` motions, and `is`/`as` text objects do The Right Thing™.

However, if I reformat the text through `par(1)`, it collapses multiple runs of spaces to a single space, breaking my sentence-motions in `vi`/`vim` meaning that example text gets treated like four separate sentences or one whole sentence.

Is there a way to disable this space-munging while keeping the rest of the `par(1)` behaviors? I was unable to determine anything relevant in the man-page (the closest I've come is playing with the `guess` parameter, but either it doesn't do what I was hoping, or I'm doing something wrong).
