SOLVED: I removed the `--modify-window=1` flag and now it runs as expected.

New cmd line in

`rsync -a --delete --progress --human-readable --stats --size-only --no-perms --no-owner --no-group -v -i "$SRC" "$DESTINATION"`

Original post:

I'm trying to get this to work in a script with the idea that only incremental files gets added to my external NTFS drive, is this possible? Everytime I run the command it recopies everything taking several hours. What is the best solution here for an incremental backup? Will rsync do the job or do I need to look at something different?

My rsync line currently looks like this

    rsync -a --delete --progress --human-readable --stats --no-o --no-g --size-only --no-perms --modify-window=1 "$SRC" "$DESTINATION" 

I've included the flags if you don't want to look it up.

    -a (archive mode) This is a shorthand for several options, which ensure that rsync behaves like an archiving tool. It preserves symbolic links, permissions, timestamps, and recursive copying of directories. --no-o (do not preserve owner) Tells rsync not to preserve the owner information of the files. This is helpful when transferring files between different operating systems (e.g., Linux to NTFS) that do not support the same ownership information. --no-g (do not preserve group) Tells rsync not to preserve group information. Similar to --no-o, this is useful when copying between file systems that donâ€™t share the same group structure. --size-only Only compares file sizes when determining whether files have changed. This ignores modification times and other metadata, and is useful when file timestamps are inconsistent between source and destination, but file contents are the same. --no-perms Tells rsync not to preserve file permissions. Useful when transferring between file systems that do not support Linux-style permissions, such as when copying to NTFS or FAT32. --modify-window=1 This option is used to handle time differences between file systems. It allows for a 1-second difference in file modification times when comparing files. This is helpful when copying between file systems like NTFS and ZFS (or other Linux file systems) that have different timestamp precision.
