I call it git-highlight. I originally called it git-sleepy (but I realized that's not super helpful lol).

I work on lots of side projects at night and many times until I'm falling asleep at my desk. However, in that sleepy state I often get "stuck" going in-and-out of consciousness without having finished my git command. I usually get stuck on something like "git push" or "git commit -m '...'". These actions can be sensitive.

I've gotten myself into haunting headaches before just for not thinking these through or for errors.  
So... I think I solved the tiniest problem ever...

Anyway, I purposefully "over-worked" the website for this tiny tool. I think it's hilarious. But honestly, so helpful for when it matters.

Let me know what you think!
