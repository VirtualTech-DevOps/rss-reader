Just wanted to share a little music making tool I've been working on since this summer.

It's a generative and non-linear midi sequencer called Signls, and it's a TUI. You place nodes on a grid. Nodes relay signals and trigger midi notes. It works with all midi compatible instruments (hardware or software)

There are 9 types of nodes to choose from, each with specific behavior. And you can pretty much randomize every parameters.

I wanted to explore the command line as a music making platform. The [live coding community](https://www.reddit.com/r/livecoding/) use it a lot already, mainly because they use programming languages as their instrument. There's also [Orca](https://100r.co/site/orca.html) that provides a more graphical way of programming the music, but it's still fairly low level. Signls sits in a higher level, providing more immediate and, hopefully, easier tools to use.

It's cross-platform and open-source.

I would gladly take feedback on this!
