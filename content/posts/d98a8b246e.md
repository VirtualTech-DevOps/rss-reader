This was something that was missing from the tools that I currenly use, luckily with a bit of **fzf** and a single incantation, I had a terminal 'app' doing exactly what I wanted. It uses **ripgrep** and **fd** rather than grep and find respectively. Posting in case it is useful:

Tested and working with ncmpcpp. Shared due to my perpetual amazement that you can do this stuff with linux.
