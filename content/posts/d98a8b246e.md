This was something that was missing from the tools that I currenly use, luckily with a bit of **fzf** and a single incantation, I had a terminal 'app' doing exactly what I wanted. Posting in case it is useful:

`fd . '/path/to/musicdir/' --changed-within "240h" --min-depth 2 -d 2 | rg -v '@' | fzf --multi | xargs -I{} find "{}" -type f \( -iname "*.mp3" -o -iname "*.flac" \) -print0 | sort -z | tr '\0' '\n' > /path/to/playlists/newmusic.m3u`

This assumes you have a neatly structured music library that goes {artist}{album}{tracks}.

Tested and working with ncmpcpp. Shared due to my perpetual amazement that you can do this stuff with linux.
