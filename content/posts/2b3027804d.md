Hello everybody,

maybe you can help me. The sources on the internet can't anymore.

I have installed aerc and I have create a google mail app password.

I have configured aerc accordingly (IMAP, SMTP, STARTTLS) with that very app password but  
unfortunately I can't fetch my emails.

Any idea is more than welcome.

The error I get is:

Googlemail: EOF  
Googlemail: reconnecting  
Googlemail: reconnect in 3s  
Googlemail: reconnect in 2s  
Googlemail: reconnect in 1s  
Googlemail: reconnecting

This is my configuration:

File: accounts.conf

───────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1 │ \[Googlemail\]  
2 │ source = imap://my.name%40googlemail.com:\[[password@imap.googlemail.com](mailto:password@imap.googlemail.com)\](mailto:[password@imap.googlemail.com](mailto:password@imap.googlemail.com)):993  
3 │ outgoing = smtp://my.name%40googlemail.com:\[[password@smtp.googlemail.com](mailto:password@smtp.googlemail.com)\](mailto:[password@smtp.googlemail.com](mailto:password@smtp.googlemail.com)):587  
4 │ default = INBOX  
5 │ from = "My Name" \[[my.name@googlemail.com](mailto:my.name@googlemail.com)\](mailto:[my.name@googlemail.com](mailto:my.name@googlemail.com))  
6 │ cache-headers = true

It should be working because I did create a password with Gmail for the purpose of the app as Google suggests here (16 letters password): [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
