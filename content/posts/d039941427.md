Tabry is my hobby project which started out as a Ruby gem for more easily writing shell (tab) completion for CLIs that didn't have it built-in. Soon after, it also became (yet another) Ruby gem for writing CLIs (with extra focus on tab completion). Recently, I rewrote the tab completion engine and compiler in Rust, which makes it feel much more responsive and is a bit simpler to install. I still use the Ruby version for writing Ruby CLIs and can even be used in conjunction with the quicker Rust tab completion engine. Tabry uses a mini-language for describing CLI arguments/flags/completion options.
