Hi all, I've been working on a new project recently focused on taking the endless configuration out of the popular note taking software Obsidian (tentatively going with the name 'Silica'), and would love any input.

The project started as a couple of simple scripts for quickly creating markdown files and saving them to my obsidian vault. It's expanded since then but it's still intended to be a way to quickly and easily make, edit, and organise notes into relevant subdirectories without leaving your terminal window using Neovim. It also includes an option to use OpenAI's API to parse notes and give them relevant file names, with a view to extend this to include writing summary files for sub-directories or individual notes.

Currently the tool has the following options: - `config` is used to configure the target directory for your obsidian vault, and set your Open AI API key if you choose to use this feature - `list` is used to list all notes in your vault - `add` is used to create a new note, by default it creates the note in a directory named after your current git repository, with the filename being the current timestamp - `edit` is used to edit an existing note, and uses `readline` to offer auto-complete suggestions to save you typing out entire file paths - `clean` is used to parse a file and rename it based on the file contents. It uses the same `readline` tool to offer auto-complete suggestions for the file paths

I'm currently also working on an ncurses based terminal user interface, extending the `clean` option to optionally run on entire directory paths as well as just individual files, and to generate summary files for directories.

The project is definitely early days, so is a little lacking currently in terms of CI/CD, documentation and such, but these things are certainly coming. If anyone would like to take a look, try it out, or even contribute, then please feel free. Thanks for any feedback you might have
