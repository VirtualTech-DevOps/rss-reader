Iâ€™ve put together a small Bash script that _wraps git log_ and calls it across multiple repositories. Works on Mac, Unix, and WSL environments. Personally, I use it at the end of each week to gather my commits for time logging at work.

    mgitlog --mroot ~/projects \ --author=jane.smith@example.com --since "1 week ago"

Feedback and suggestions are appreciated.
