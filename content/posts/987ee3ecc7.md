Does anyone know of any terminal emulators for PowerPC machines that support sixel graphics? I have an iMac G4 running Mac OS 9.2.2 and 10.4.11, and would like to access a telnet server that supports sixel images, but I'm having some trouble finding terminal emulators old enough that display them â€“ did they exist, or have they been preserved today?
