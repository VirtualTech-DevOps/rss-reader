Hello, Im an extreme noob and hope it's okay to ask this here. A friend wrote me a .bat file to use command line to convert mp4 to png and then use gifski to convert to GIF (this is how it works for gifski on Windows - mp4 needs converted to png and then feed the png into gifski to create the GIF). The thing is he has gone on holiday and I don't want to bother him, so I'm trying to figure out on my own. Here is a screenshot of the .bat file he created for me (some instructions are in spanish though):

It works flawlessly, but the only inconvnience is I need to do it file per file. I'd love to just stick all files in one folder and convert them in batch, but I have no idea how. I'v tried following some instructions from google but I'm not being able to succeed.

Sorry if this is too basic, if not allowed please delete! It's just that command line for me is pretty much like reading hieroglyphics
