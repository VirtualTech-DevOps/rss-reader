Hi everyone, it's been a minute since the initial discussion post about quality control issues. Let's talk about it.

The general consensus seemed to be that our ideas on what to change were good, though there could be more resources to help beginners. We actually have a [subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/index/) that anyone can contribute to, as long as you have 500+ subreddit karma and your account is 30+ days old. We also have a [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/info/) of todo items for the wiki to help users find somewhere to start.

Another concern was that the stricter enforcement of the defaults rule may stop people from using existing color schemes or themes at all. This is not the case -- the intention of the rule is to remove posts which have little effort or just use premade configs, like many macOS and Windows lookalikes. It's about the spirit, not the letter of the rule.

With this in mind, we intend to go through with these rule changes. If you still have any concerns, please reply or send a modmail! We're most concerned with the quality of our community and welcome discussion.
