Iâ€™ve searched through various posts and related subreddits but they all assume you have some level of knowledge with script writing.

I literally have no background in this. I have a Mac and Iâ€™ve seen/opened the terminal - that is the farthest Iâ€™ve ever gone.

I work in higher ed with our tech stack on set up, onboarding, daily maintenance, training, etc etc which is easy because someone else already created the tools in a nice prepackaged way and I just have to read the manual and click on them/use them. Iâ€™ve learned a lot of ed platforms over the years so I can read and click for sure ðŸ™ƒ

However, the more I learn about these platforms the more I realize how restrictive they are set up to be and how much I could do with it if I had some deeper knowledge.

Where can I go to get started? Iâ€™ve checked out some yt channels and again, there is some foundational knowledge basis there which I do not have.

I need sources that assume Iâ€™m a complete novice/idiot (which is true).
