I have a game file in Application Support symbolically linked to an smb share.

The game runs finely when I connect to the server using the Finder app. However, when I connect through mount\_smbfs, the launcher gives off a permission warning and doesn’t start.

So I did some ls’ing, and found out that the folder I mount to, using the cli, is owned by wheel. On the other hand, the folder Finder app creates, is owned by staff.

I mount into /Volumes, using :

sudo mkdir /Volumes/share

Followed by

sudo mount\_smbfs //user:pass@server/share /Volumes/share

How do i go about fixing this, chmod or chown? Or is there a way to include that into the mkdir command?
