Check out the [demo video](https://youtu.be/eOWOEvO5uys)!

Here's what this tool does:

*   Installs browser extensions.
    
*   Supports JavaScript-based configuration files to set custom preferences.
    

With `extension`, you can script your browser environment to install and customize the extensions you need.

It's built for Chrome, but it also works with Edge and [Arc](https://arc.net) by extension. (No pun extended.)

[Setup and usage instructions](https://github.com/8ta4/extension) are on GitHub. It's free, open-source, and currently for macOS only. Let me know if you have feedback or ideas!
