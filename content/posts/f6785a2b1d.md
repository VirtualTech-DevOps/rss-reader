Let me start this rant again.

Imagine you just made a perfect and original rice, for example, with sided bar and unique window style. You publish it, you wait a day, two...and almost nothing. You look at new posts and you get shocked: near-default KDE rice with anime girl got 600+ upvotes in first two days! How **that** can be?

Yes, again, im talking about the near-default rices problem. Today unixporn can't actually live without them, but hear me out: that's such a horrible situation, when original rices get **way** less attention than a default one. Again, third rule of unixporn: no nearly default rices. But nobody cares. And everyone even supports it! This needs to be stopped.

I want to remind you of this little arrow just next to the upvote button. Yes, I ask you to downvote posts with defaults and near-defaults in order to promote other authours and rices that deserve our attention more than a typical anime girl with default "konsole".

A small step for one person, a big step for the whole unixporn.
