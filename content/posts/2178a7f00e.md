nchess supports the full move rules of chess and runs on both Linux and Windows. You can play games, edit and analyze positions. On Linux you can connect UCI engines (i.e. Stockfish), but unfortunately this is not supported on Windows yet.

Please try to break it or make it do weird things as this is the first release!
