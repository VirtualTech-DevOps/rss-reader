Hi everyone! üëã

I‚Äôm exploring the idea of a plug-and-play analytics solution designed specifically for CLI applications ‚Äî think **Google Analytics, but tailored to CLI tools**. Here‚Äôs a rough outline of what I envision:

*   **SDKs for Major Languages**: Simple integration for popular languages used in CLI development (Go, Python, Rust, etc.)
*   **Command Execution Tracking**: Automatically tracks command usage with configurable granularity and privacy options.
*   **Error and Crash Reporting**: Built-in crash and error reporting to help identify and prioritize issues.
*   **Opt-in/Opt-out Flexibility**: Support for customizable privacy strategies to ensure users can choose their data sharing preferences.
*   **Web Dashboard for Data Analysis**: Centralized interface to analyze collected data, usage patterns, and errors.

I started thinking about this after hitting roadblocks in prioritizing features and fixing bugs in my own open-source CLI tool. Now, I‚Äôm curious to know if others see value in a tool like this.

**Does this sound useful for your CLI projects? Are there any features you‚Äôd need or concerns you‚Äôd have?**

Any feedback would be hugely appreciated üôè Thank you in advance!
