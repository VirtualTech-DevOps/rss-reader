[![Portable CLI tar.gz installer](https://external-preview.redd.it/TL8TK2GMj9hXv_q_MPbLX0BCBiWZB6NQ9Wo-Kw0g9ow.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=530f29b1a5c9ec2077b20cd242dfeda916b9119f "Portable CLI tar.gz installer")](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1gnxtvi/portable_cli_targz_installer/)

I'm working on a tiny package manager of sorts for tar/tar.gz/tar.xz and similar formats. It works on Linux and macOS for now, but it's built to be portable and extensible so it'll probably be on Windows, BSD and others fairly soon. I use it myself to install annoying programs like Discord.
