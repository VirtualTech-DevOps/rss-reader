I'm backing up files which may have an emoji in their name. Using cp to copy them gives an Illegal byte sequence error and does not copy the file.

Is it possible to copy files regardless and just drop the part of the name that it doesn't accept?

export LC\_CTYPE=C LANG=C  
me@me-iMac videos % cp \*wJYTlXPW0\*.mp4 ~/Downloads  
cp: /Users/me/Downloads/ðŸ«  \[c\_wJYTlXPW0\].mp4: Illegal byte sequence
