I have a [demo](https://youtu.be/-gOFmlQP9IA)!

Here's what the tool does:

*   Tracks changes made to system or app preferences.
    
*   Generates `PlistBuddy` commands.
    

With this, you can script your macOS setup and recreate your environment on new machines.

Now, I know what you're thinking, but let me assure you, I absolutely do not have OCD. [If I had a penny for every time someone said they think I have OCD... I'd have 1,526 pennies.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/87jb90/if_i_had_a_penny_for_every_time_someone_said_they)

[Installation and usage instructions](https://github.com/8ta4/plist) are on GitHub. It's free and open-source. Let me know if you have feedback or ideas!
