So, what I really wanna go for is a retro, 90s-styled rice. My desktop environment of choice is LXQt, since it is not only lightweight, but also IMO the easiest to customize into something retro-themed. But I've been having issues with fonts - I wanna use some pixelart ones, but the smoothing makes them look egregious. But when I turn the smoothing off, fonts in programs like Discord or Telegram now look awful. So, does anyone possibly know a way around it? Have the window decorations, panel and programs that use system's native font with smoothing disabled by default, but enabled for programs that come with their own UI? That'd be extremely helpful.
