I am trying to use `vhs` to make recordings to use in READMEs. Unfortunately, I don't have access to a physical computer(I have been using Termux).

I tried installing it. But it doesn't seem to work(empty gif).

//// //// //// ////

I basically need to run the commands on someone else's machine to get it to work(kinda like how `GitHub actions` work) and somehow get the output files.

Is there any way to achieve this?

> P.S. preferably it's something that doesn't require a fee(since I won't be doing this regularly). And I have no idea if VMs even allow this(retrieving files from them).
