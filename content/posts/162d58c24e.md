[![My new silly project : wtf command](https://external-preview.redd.it/rcVWGInfMnCLcto4KuBaovohDYA6qG1qlU6adOvAbTM.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ee189640bfb3453a4f6650a3a388911fe556ec34 "My new silly project : wtf command")](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1gvumph/my_new_silly_project_wtf_command/)

I saw this video today [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdoaiGTIBY4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdoaiGTIBY4)  
This showcases a command

    wtf is <something> 

I liked it and wanted to have it in personal system. Couldn't easily find a way to get it and decided to build a very simple one of my own that uses wikipedia for data.  
It's a simple golang script hosted on [https://github.com/GrayHat12/wtf](https://github.com/GrayHat12/wtf)  
Just wanted to share it incase anyone's interested.  
Thanks
