I have a folder on a 2nd drive called "Program Files." Not sure how it got there but I don't need / want it.

If I try to delete in Explorer, it says I need permission from SYSTEM. I don't know anybody by that name, it's my computer, I'm giving it administrator permission...but it still wants to do its own thing because Microsoft.

In cmd I've tried a few things including del and rmdir including /s and /f. It asks if I'm sure and I say Y. Yet the folder is still there. What gives?

To be clear, this is not a system folder or something Windows SHOULD be trying to block me from deleting. It's on a 2nd data drive.
