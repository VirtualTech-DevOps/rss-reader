Hello!

I've created a [new website](https://awesome-bash-scripts.vercel.app/) to share with the world some of my terminal scripts. As a terminal enthusiast, I rely heavily on shortcuts to streamline my workflow. Some of my custom aliases are bash scripts written in Ruby, which I've included on this site. While the collection is currently short, I plan to expand it over time.

I'm happy to share and I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Would you find a "how to" guide for using and storing these scripts helpful?

Thanks in advance!
