Hey everyone!

I recently came across an AI Reddit bot on Product Hunt that can search Reddit and use AI to reply to certain posts. I thought it was a really cool concept, so I decided to try building my own version—even though I had no prior experience with Python, machine learning, or AI.

After some trial and error, I managed to create and publish a CLI tool that lets anyone easily build a bot directly from the command line. The bot can search for specific keywords and automatically leave comments on posts that match those keywords.

It’s still an early version and definitely needs more work, but I’m excited about the progress so far. I’d love to get some feedback from this community, so let me know what you think.

Thanks!
