Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been working on a new CLI tool, `export-code-pdf-cli`, that Iâ€™m excited to share with you. This tool lets ou **exort the content of all the code files in your project into a single PDF**, which can then be imported into **ChatGPT**. The idea is to make it super easy to work on large projects with AI assistance.

ðŸ”§ What does it do?
===================

`export-code-pdf-cli` is a command-line tool that allows you to:

*   **Filter files using a regex**: Select files based on a regex pattern (e.g., all `.js` or `.py` files).
*   **Concatenate all the code files in your project** into one single document.
*   **Export it into a PDF file**.

The key advantage of exporting your entire project as a **PDF** is that you can **import that PDF directly into ChatGPT** and have the AI review your whole project at once. This is great if you need assistance or feedback on the overall structure or specific pieces of your code.

ðŸ’¡ Why use this?
================

Letâ€™s face it: Copy-pasting large code files into ChatGPT can get tedious. Instead of going file by file, you can now **export the entire project** into a single PDF and then upload that PDF into ChatGPT. This is particularly useful when:

*   You want to review your **entire project** with ChatGPT at once.
*   You need assistance with **code spanning multiple files**.
*   You want to ask ChatGPT for refactoring or debugging tips on your project without switching contexts.

ðŸ›  How does it work?
====================

After installing the CLI, you can run a simple command to generate the PDF:

    export-code-pdf-cli -r '.*\.js$' -d ./src -o ./project-code.pdf 

This will scan the `./src` directory, pick up all the `.js` files, and export them into `project-code.pdf`.

ðŸŒŸ Features:
============

*   **Regex filtering**: Use regex to select which files to include (e.g., `.js`, `.py`, or specific patterns).
*   **Concatenation**: Merges all the code files in your project into one continuous PDF.
*   **Ideal for AI imports**: Perfect for importing into ChatGPT to analyze your entire project at once.

ðŸ“¦ Installation
===============

You can either install it globally via **npm** or directly from the **GitHub repo**:

Option 1: Install via npm
=========================

    npm install -g export-code-pdf-cli 

Option 2: Install directly from GitHub (without npm)
====================================================

1.  Clone the repo:git clone [https://github.com/agarrec-vivlio/export-code-pdf-cli.git](https://github.com/agarrec-vivlio/export-code-pdf-cli.git)
2.  Navigate into the directory and install dependencies:cd export-code-pdf-cli npm install
3.  Link it globally:npm link

ðŸš€ Try it out
=============

You can find the full project and instructions on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/agarrec-vivlio/export-code-pdf-cli). Feel free to give it a try and let me know how it goes! ðŸŽ‰

If youâ€™re looking for a way to easily **import your entire project into ChatGPT** for analysis or feedback, I hope this tool makes your workflow smoother!

Let me know if you have any feedback or ideas for new features. Happy coding
