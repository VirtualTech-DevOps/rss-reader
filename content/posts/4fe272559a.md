I'm attempting to get into [`edit-and-execute-command (C-x C-e)`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Miscellaneous-Commands) using Cygwin for Window 11, however, when I hit the keys I'm met with a bell and ^X printed to the terminal.

I've tried to see if it was something to do with using Windows Terminal so I set it back to Windows Console Host (CONHOST), ran the batch file, called `bash --login -i` from CMD, MinTTY, and ConEmu. I've imported the .inputrc and .bashrc files along with ConEmu settings from Cygwin for Windows 10 which is confirmed to work. Tried setting $TERM in .bashrc to be blank, cygwin, or xterm-256color; both $EDITOR and $VISUAL are set. BLE.sh has been disabled in case there was some options in there and it still doesn't work.

Curiouser that the other C-x/^x shortcuts are hit or miss on the various terminals. For example, `display-shell-version (C-x C-v)` only works in MinTTY and CONHOST. In both ConEmu and Windows Terminal it prints ^X then pastes the clipboard. I would have figured that it would have been uniform across the terminals.

I'm at a loss for what it could be on Win11 if I may ask for help.
