Long story short, I was trying to add HFS+ drivers to my brother’s windows 11 PC. From a MacRumors forum I added two drivers to system32, and ran a registry file. After restarting the PC cannot boot, attempts an automatic repair then gets stuck on the troubleshoot screen.

I attempted to remove the drivers through the CMD but they are not found in the system 32 folder. I attempted the registry uninstall commands (in the cmd) from the registry removal file, but get the error ‘unable to find specified registry key or value’.

Please ignore my idiocy, is there any way to undo this or backup files?? In the CMD the downloads file is empty.
