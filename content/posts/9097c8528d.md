`git-conform` is a simple git extension that helps you to keep track of the repositories on your local machine and their remote counterparts. It works by scanning your **home directory** (or just the ones you specified) in search for git repositories, and then storing their paths in the tracking file located at `~/.local/share/git-conform`.
