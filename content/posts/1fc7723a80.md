The pas few weeks I learnt a few tips about colour in a terminal, and as my brain really work well with colour categorisation, I was amazed and thought I'd share.

Colours through the pipe.
-------------------------

When piping a command like `ls`, colours disappears. `ls` know the difference between an interactive shell and a pipeline and does not generate escape sequences in order to not break further data processing. (It is the `--color=auto` parameter)

But most command in which you pipe things can support colour output including less and watch.

For it to work you have to : 1. pass a flag to allowed escape sequence interpretation (`watch -c` or `less -r`) 1. Force colours on the input command (`ls --color=always` or `jq -C`)

Network Colourfiguration
------------------------

The `ip` command has colour output. I didn't knew as I always saw thing like this on bashrc :

`alias ls='ls --color=auto' alias grep='grep --color=auto'` And never `alias ip='ip -color=auto'`. But it does exist ! And it even have a setting for black background with the env variable `COLORFGBG=";0"`

No material theme file manager
------------------------------

The GNU's `ls` command, which you provably have, have an LS\_COLOR environment variable in which you can list patterns on filenames and attribute them a given colour. The process might seem complex but [some people already took care of it for us !](https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS)

What else ?
-----------

What are your tips regarding colourful terminals ? Did I miss something ?
