Hello.

Internally, I use fetchmail to consolidate my various domains into one master local server. I keep the last ~7 days on the remote server, until they are purged, so that I can still view urgent messages using webmail.

This is a basic crontab to use with fetchmail, when using the 'keep' directive.

    MAILTO="" */5 * * * * cd $HOME; flock "/var/lock/fetchmail.$(whoami).lock" fetchmail 01 0 * * 0 cd $HOME; flock "/var/lock/fetchmail.$(whoami).lock" fetchmail --flush
