Hello everyone,

I’ve been working on my first project in Go for about two months now and have recently released version 1. The goal of this project was to learn the language and create an app that I can use to organize my student life.

The application is a simple TUI that includes a calendar and a basic note-taking feature. It uses vim-style keybindings, allowing you to stay in your dev workflow while organizing your week!

Here’s the repo: [https://github.com/HubertBel/lazyorg](https://github.com/HubertBel/lazyorg)

Feel free to share any feedback on the project since it’s my first time using Go!
