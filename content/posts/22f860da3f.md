Hi all, in my application, I am using Ghostscript to convert RGB to CMYK in a PDF. The conversion works, but I can't control the CMYK values from the RGB input. For example, the expected black CMYK value is 0/0/0/100, but the actual values are different. Does anyone have an idea on how to control this from HTML, or know of any plugin that can control the CMYK values? Alternatively, is there a way to control Ghostscript directly
