I'm trying to find a KDE Plasma 6 theme that looks like this, I sadly don't even know the name of this style.

What I mean exactly, is the light grey to dark grey gradient many old DE's had iirc or the windows vista taskbar but without the transparency.

There is also a Openbox theme called Onyx that goes into that direction.
