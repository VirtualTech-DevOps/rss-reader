I have a .rar file which contains an epub. I am trying to extract the epub file from the rar file. I can use The Unarchiver to do this easily, but I want to do it from the command line.

So I did:

`tar -xvf my_epub.rar`

The result was not the epub file, but the epub file unzipped. epub files are just zip files, and apparently tar wants to unrar and then unzip. I just want to unrar. Can I do this with tar? If not, what command line utility allows me to do this?
