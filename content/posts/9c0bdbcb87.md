Hi ! I've been using catppuccin for all my rices from more than a year and I would like to change, but i've a problem. I'm not into design, frontend etc at all so I don't know anything about colorscheme. What type of color do I need. What's the difference between foreground, overlay etc. So if anyone could sumup everything :pray: ?
