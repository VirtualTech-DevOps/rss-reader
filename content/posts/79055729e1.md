Hey everyone!

I just finished building a simple but powerful email spammer called **youGotMail** in **Rust**. It allows you to send emails to a list of targets using your own Gmail accounts.

### Key Features:

*   **Rust-Based**: Written in Rust for speed and efficiency.
*   **Gmail Integration**: Uses your Gmail account credentials to send emails.
*   **Target List**: You can provide a list of email addresses to which the mails will be sent.

### Usage:

*   Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/NewDawn0/youGotMail`
*   Set up your Gmail account.
*   Modify the target email list in the config.
*   Run the program to send emails.
