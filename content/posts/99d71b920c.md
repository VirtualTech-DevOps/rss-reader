Hey everyone!

I'm curious‚Äî**what features do you wish you could integrate into your terminal** to make your workflow smoother or more enjoyable?

I'm currently developing a project called [**HomeSetup**](https://github.com/yorevs/homesetup) project aimed at enhancing and customizing terminal environments for developers. Whether it's advanced theming, plugin support, automation tools, or anything else, I'd love your suggestions!

I have already integrated the following:

*   [**Starship**](https://starship.rs/)**:** Elevate your terminal experience with this highly customizable prompt.
*   [**ColorLS**](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)**:** Add colorized and feature-rich directory listings for improved readability.
*   [**FZF**](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/fzf-linux-fuzzy-finder)**:** Enjoy the power of fuzzy search for rapid navigation and command-line operations.
*   [**GTrash**](https://github.com/umlx5h/gtrash)**:** Manage file deletion effortlessly with this trash-cli alternative.
*   [**NeoVim**](https://neovim.io/)**:** A hyper-extensible, modern rewrite of Vim, offering improved performance and enhanced plugins for developers and power users.
*   [**Sdiff**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sdiff.1.html) **+** [**Colordiff**](https://www.colordiff.org/)**:** Compare and colorize file differences directly in your terminal, providing an intuitive way to track changes between files.

üîç **Check out the project's README here:** [HomeSetup README](https://github.com/yorevs/homesetup/blob/master/README.md)

Your feedback can help shape the next features of HomeSetup! Feel free to:

*   Share the features you find essential for your terminal setup

Let's build a powerful and flexible terminal environment together! üöÄ
