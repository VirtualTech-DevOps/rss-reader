I use hyprland, used i3wm before... and started from ofc gnome, The only one thing i think when i use a tiling wm i love it everything from customizablity to the level of its on you how you polish it mantain it... But idk why but i like tiling windows but clicky stuff on desktop... I Completely go opposite of tiling aspects.

I dont know why but whenever i try a desktop it feels better... But when i get too many windows on that i am like meh its not good, i want tiling

I Think I should use XFCE+TilingWM
