Is there a good CLI web browser available currently? I don't really want or need JS support.

I've looked at **lynx** but it seems like lynx doesn't support HTML5 and has a long configuration process to provide a good experience. It also doesn't support table structures very well.

**w3m** seemed like a good browser but apparently doesn't get maintained anymore, which makes me a bit worried for its future.

Do you know of any other good alternatives to these?
