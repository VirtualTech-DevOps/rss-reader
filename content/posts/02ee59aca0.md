RPN is a CLI RPN calculator for Linux. Unlike most existing alternatives, it's meant to be purely CLI, but also user friendly. RPN includes several useful features like auto print of stack, formatted numbers, readline-like data entry, responsible use of colors, etc.

RPN supports many functions, including trigonometric functions, logical functions (or/and/xor/not), as well as multiple bases (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal.)

Version 1.0.0 is finally out. This version comes with a lot of fixes and a big change: decimal math. RPN can now handle larger numbers with better precision.

Hope you enjoy it.
