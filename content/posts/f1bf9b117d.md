Over the past few months I've been developing a CLI tool that I call `hit`(see [documentation](https://github.com/meshde/hit-cli-issues)) which turns API endpoints into command-line commands.

I personally prefer not to use any kind of GUI tools and try to do all parts of the software development workflow in the terminal and I could not find anything that would help me with API testing or invoking internal admin API endpoints on prod for handling customer support issues (if there's no Admin UI for those endpoints) that I could manage in the terminal. We do have awesome tools like `httpie` but I still needed to maintain the endpoints to invoke and their parameters in bash scripts which was a bit of a hassle.

Enter `hit`, a productivity-focussed API client that is powered through a json config file which can include the list of API endpoints and their parameters and each such endpoint can then be invoked as a sub-command of the \`hit\` command. It supports:

*   configuring variables that can be included in the endpoint URL in the config where the values to the variables can be provided as command-line flags/arguments when running the command.
*   support for running post response scripts using the response of the API calls.
*   Multi-environment set up with variables having different values in different environment that can be switched into. Major use case of this would be to store and use different API domains for different environments, such as production, staging and local.

Major benefits over tools like Postman:

1.  The obvious one of being used/managed from the terminal. This one is a benefit only if you prefer doing things in the terminal as opposed to a GUI.
2.  Unlimited collaborators to manage `hit` in your project without having to pay for any per seat subscription. `hit` is completely driven from a json config file which is meant to be committed to the git repo of the project (each project would have a different config file) and hence can be shared with the team and changes to the config file can be peer-reviewed.
3.  Since `hit` is run in the terminal, the post response scripts can be written and run using any scripting language/tool that is installed on your machine as opposed to having to write scripts in the language that the API client tool supports.
4.  Since `hit` is run in the terminal, you have the ability to combine the hit commands that invoke your API endpoints with the plethora of command-line tools that you would normally use in your workflow. For example:
    1.  If your API returns a json response but you want to see the output in tabular format, simply pipe the response of the command into `jq` to convert the response into TSV or CSV format.
    2.  Want to re-invoke a previously invoked endpoint? Use the [reverse search](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learn-linux-shell/9781788995597/85d106f3-cc78-42d4-90d9-4a944db3c065.xhtml) functionality in your shell for easily searching for previously run commands.
    3.  Want to invoke an endpoint in a loop with different parameters? Just write a quick bash script that loops through your parameters and invokes the endpoint using `hit` in each loop.

I've been using `hit` in my development workflows for the last 7 months and can say for sure that it is a great productivity booster. The features supported so far have been focussed on boosting MY productivity, so I wanted to take this time to release it to the public and get feedback on how it can be improved to be able to boost the productivity for other developers out there.

Please feel free to reach out to me on DM if you need help setting `hit` up for your project.
