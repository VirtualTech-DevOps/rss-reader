I'm an image manipulator and I prefeer to use linux to work with image files, one day I've stumbled upon an online tool capable of mapping each pixel of a raster image into an SVG vector square without using lines to make approximation of the image.

I think that there are plenty of image mapping algorithm that you can already have compiled or installed on a local client pc without having to go throught websites in order to access those tools.

I think that it would be handy to use an algorithm like this one on a local linux machine that can be integrated on my own personal workflow so that I would do things like mass pixel mappings to SVG square vectors or things like that. I know about the png2svg commandline tool, but that one is no longer mantained as far as I know.
