stupid question..

I keep getting this error everytime i open my terminal that has starship installed.

`[ERROR] - (starship::config): Unable to read config file content: Permission denied (os error 13)`

But my config is already working fine, with the theme and everything applied.

the path for my config is `$HOME/.config/starship/starship.toml`

im saying the path because this error might be caused by the config (starship.toml) not being just in the `$HOME` directory.

If im right, please let me know.
