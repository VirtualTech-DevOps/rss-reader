I've been using gnome (and sometimes xfce) ever since I started using linux. I've come to like tiling WMs more after looking at all these rices on this sub.

I'd love to hear what WM would you recommend for an average gnome user to switch to? I don't want _too_ steep of a learning curve, though. Thanks y'all.
