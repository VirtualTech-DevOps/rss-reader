I'm not personally a fan of the Vim style of doing things (swapping between Insert and Command for typing and navigation), I prefer using modifier keys for hotkeys while also being able to type at the same time. Having an optional command palette is also fine.

Ideally it will be cross platform. I'm currently in the process of transitioning away from Windows but am having major difficulties in actually dropping it entirely, so ideally the text editor should work on Windows as well as Linux.

Doesn't need to be insanely feature-rich or anything (I use VSCode for actual IDE stuff) but also the more features the better. Stuff like syntax-highlighting and a decent theme that doesn't make my eyes bleed would be nice (not personally a fan of staring into the abyssal void of the pitch-black default terminal lol).

Any suggestions at all would be much appreciated.
