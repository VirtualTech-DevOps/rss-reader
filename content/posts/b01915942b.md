[![cdb: Change to a dir you see](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4rrixq-3IENVEk-slQjl2MQgk99qnLutrF19IZqeS3s.jpg "cdb: Change to a dir you see")](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1fudfuk/cdb_change_to_a_dir_you_see/)

I wrote a "cdb" command (chdir to buffer) which, in tmux, gets the scroll back buffer, examines it for paths, and presents then as a menu to chdir to. (It's written in perl to be much faster than, say, python. Although you might want to modify its path-matching regex's).

This is useful as many commands output paths which you aren't prepared for and have to copy and paste.

(It requires a function to wrap it so the chdir will go through. It's main drawback is that, if you go back in history, only "cdb" shows as the command (you don't see the directory).

cdb () { local dir="$(find-buffer-path.pl)"; if \[\[ -n $dir \]\]; then cd "$dir"; else echo 'No dirs found' 1>&2; fi }

find-buffer-path.pl is here: [https://gist.github.com/dcfdabf1f3c5576a476c283379df04c4](https://gist.github.com/dcfdabf1f3c5576a476c283379df04c4)
