I am talking about that line in the middle of the screen.

I am using `fish` and this is what causes the bug. \`\`\`fish

Adds fake padding to bold & other mode texts
============================================

set -lx LESS\_TERMCAP\_me (printf " ")(set\_color normal) \`\`\`

It goes away if I resize the window or scroll horizontally.

But I can't seem to get rid of it.
