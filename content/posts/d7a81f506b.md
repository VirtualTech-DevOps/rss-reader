Hi everyone. I know, that is maybe strange question, but i need to chose tui library. I want to use compiled language, so i chose between C++(have experience), Rust(seems hard, but toolchain is nice) and Zig(New and easy to read)

So which library you think will be best for that? I want to write small filemanager, also I want library that will be supported and efficient, need your help and experience!

If you know only one, just give me advantages and disadvantages. Thanks!
