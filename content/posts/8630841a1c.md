Hello unixporners! You might be interested in what wm is the best to use. In this sub, many of them were used for posting rices. So, why don't we make a little "top"? Today I've created a tier list with several window managers that were found in the posts here. Every 2 days we vote for one place and one wm. There are 11 of them in total: i3, sway, river, xmonad, hyprland, bspwm, DWM, qtile, awesomewm, openbox and herbstluftwm. Also there are only 5 ranks for them, so comparing won't be boring:) Today, let's find a place for qtile! Write your opinion in the comments, look for other's thoughts, discuss and have fun!

P.S. the tier list itself is in the comments
