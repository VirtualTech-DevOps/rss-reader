I know the title sounds simple but I am asking for a command I could use in a script which would edit a parameter=value in a text config file.

I am doing some scripting and that involves some config settings.

I could use sed maybe or just replace the whole file but I wonder if im not reinventing a wheel.

Is there something like:

updateconfig filename parametername value

of some sorts or the best I can get is sed?
