[![[Hyprland] Any tips?](https://preview.redd.it/kc5n3w3atkyd1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=52cb76275df0560b1a0c42d345b8422241206d9c "[Hyprland] Any tips?")](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1gi9zez/hyprland_any_tips/)

so i recently installed hyprland and have been wondering some things.

I've noticed it gets very difficult to properly multitask w/ a browser and discord open at the same time

usually i can just tab out on a DE but i can't on this so what should i do?

and also iâ€™ve failed to find a way to create a bind to move tiles with the arrow keys instead of my mouse (SUPER + Drag), any ideas?
