Hello,

I released a new version of Rebels in the sky: [https://github.com/ricott1/rebels-in-the-sky](https://github.com/ricott1/rebels-in-the-sky)

I think last time this was posted there was no SSH support yet, so hopefully now you can just try it out via \`ssh [frittura.org](http://frittura.org) -p 3788\`

The trailer video is from the previous version but should give a good idea of the game. It's an anarchic space-pirates basketball managerial game with some components of resource trading and a bit of spaceshooter (coming up, very basic for now), all in the command line.

It's built in Rust with Ratatui: [https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui)

Would be glad to receive feedback/suggestions/improvements!
