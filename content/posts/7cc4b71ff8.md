Basically that it can do bash-like things easily (It is a shell language), but that can be used for larger scripts without being cumbersome (apparently bash gets very bad for scripts larger than like 20 lines). I don't really care about POSIX compatibility. Edit: I'm going to go with amber (compiles to bash, so no portability issues), and perl.
