Me and my organisation (CAN) plan to work on another operating system You might not know us, we just started and we are a bunch of random people from around the world But we want to make a brand new operating system using buildroot Basically we will load xfce4 into buildroot, strip it down to a browser and make it open the browser on startup, on fullscreen This sounds stupid, and unworkable we know But its actually smart We plan on making the OS fully run inside of that browser, we will remove the new tab button, and other features to lock it on our os The os in question will be called "Kotek OS" Itll start up as a simple command line on the first boot, but itll include a install script Our filesystem is almost fully based on variables, we will try to make it so that we can get the bare Assembly code of any package installed, and make it run using some js packages, the packages will initially be stored onto variables But every minute the variables get empties into our database, allowing for seemingly endless storage, or at least as much as firebase allows, the variable based system makes it so that download and installation is as fast as possible, All of your data is saved inside of the database, all you need is to put in your username and password when logging in The os is customizable to the very boot screen Also when an update is released the os gets updated automatically, and quickly But previous versions will be available for installation, all you need to do is get the zip of the previous version, unzip it and launch the html file The os does have a browser, even though it runs in a browser

So what do yall think?
