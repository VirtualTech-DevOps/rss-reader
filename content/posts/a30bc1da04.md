I've created a tool to control my Home Assistant devices from the command line.

As i'm spending a lot of time on the command line, i was looking for a tool to easily turn on/off or toggle lights and switches, as well as play a short audio on a media player.

It seemed, that other CLI tools i found were not really focused on controlling devices, but on configuring Home Assistant. So i created a tool for myself: `hctl`

**Features**

*   Support for Home Assistant
*   Play local and remote music files
*   List all Domains & Domain-Services
*   Turn on/off, or toggle all capable devices
*   Completion for \`bash\`, \`zsh\`, \`fish\` and \`powershell\`, auto completing all capable devices
*   Control over short and long names
*   Fuzzy matching your devices so you can keep it short
