Hi, I’m writing a bash script to parse a directory with songs (.wav) to play them (via a play). The names are like:

'1-01 Up, Up And Away \[Digitally Rema.wav' '1-02 Another Day, Another Heartache.wav' '1-03 California My Way.wav' '1-04 Go Where You Wanna Go \[Digitall.wav' '1-05 Learn How To Fly \[Digitally Rem.wav' Either the quotes get removed or the file names are parsed at the spaces. I’ve tried sed, find, ls, etc. And combinations. I’ve not yet tried awk/nawk/gawk but I could if that’s the way - for that matter I could do that and use a system() call I suppose. Any ideas? TIA matt
