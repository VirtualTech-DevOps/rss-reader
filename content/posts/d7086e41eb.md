After creating my own server I tested several terminal multiplexers and chouse Byobu. It charmed me with several features:

1.  One simple command to launch it -- same command to connect to session if it's running. No searching for and entring session ID like in TMUX as I remember it. Only one command (it's name) to remember.
    
2.  Visual tabs for different windows. You can click them with a mouse. You can scrool with mouse wheel.
    
3.  TUI menu for configuration with toggles and swithes you can use insead of editing configuration files.
    
4.  You can click left mouse button anywhere on the screen to see a TUI menu on what you can do with this area. Different suggestions depending on where you clicked (system bar, a line in terminal...). No need to remember all hotkeys to start using the app.
    

Is there a TUI text editor that is similar in design philosophy? I tried many before, Micro and MCEdit probably came the closest (first--in terms of familiar keybindings, second--context menus) but still were not that novice-friendly designed as Byobu.
