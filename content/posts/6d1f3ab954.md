Hello! I'm a new computer science student and have been using the terminal more frequently on my Mac. One thing that's been frustrating is not being able to copy files—such as PDFs and images—directly to the clipboard from the terminal. For instance, I’d love to type something like `copy file.pdf` and then be able to paste it (with `Cmd + V`) directly into apps like ChatGPT without having to open the Finder and drag the file in.

Is there a command-line tool or script for macOS that would let me copy files to the clipboard as if they were manually copied? Any tips would be greatly appreciated!
