Hello!

I'm trying to follow the Git install documentation for nvm and getting unexpected returns from the terminal on the final step (about adding lines to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc)`. The terminal says I have no such file or directory. I have verified that nvm, npm, and node are all installed and up to date. I enter the prompts from the home folder. I'm on windows, so using bash technically, if that matters.

PS: I'm not a programmer, I only have a sliver of CLI/git experience. Since I'm unable to find a direct answer online, I'm probably making a very (very) basic mistake.

Link to nvm documentation, Git Install section:

Thanks for your attention, insight, and assistance!
