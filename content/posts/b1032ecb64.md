I want to make it easier to change the options for things such as ffmpeg. Here's my script, it scans for files that are eac3 format and if they are eac3 format, they are converted into aac and saved in a different folder. The original stays since it is still compatible with some media players (just not others)

`for f in *.m4a; do if [[ $(ffprobe -v error -select_streams a:0 -of csv=p=0 -show_entries stream=codec_name "$f" | awk -F, '{print $1}') == "eac3" ]]; then mkdir compat ffmpeg -i "$f" -n -c:v copy -c:a aac "compat/$f"; fi; done`

logically, I would think doing the following would be enough, but it isn't

`probeset="-v error -select_streams a:0 -of csv=p=0 -show_entries stream=codec_name" mpegset="-n -c:v copy -c:a aac" for f in *.m4a; do if [[ $(ffprobe $probeset "$f" | awk -F, '{print $1}') == "eac3" ]]; then mkdir compat ffmpeg -i "$f" $mpegset "compat/$f" fi done`

The probeset variable, I am not sure what the output is, but now it's causing ffprobe to return every file with all kinds of info instead of just the word eac3 (when it has that word). I believe it might be ignoring the word -v error. The mpegset variable is making ffmpeg ask me if I want to overwrite the files, when the -n option should already be making the decision for me

I tried to see if my other variables have similar issues, like the ones on my .bashrc or in other scripts, and they don't. They are working perfectly as intended with nothing being left out. A search online made me think it could be because of the way loop works, but the suggestions were things I didn't know how to implement here (I believe seq is only to go from numbers 1-7. Eval is to run commands, but this is not a command it's the arguments of a command)

Any help would be appreciated. It seems like a basic request but the results I found were limited in use cases.

I also prefer one-liners and that's what I used, but I turned this into a multiline so it's easier to present it to you guys.

I also have this command where I wanted to do this as well, but this one I didn't even test since the outcome is already expected and harder to notice. Use this if you prefer `default=-r 10.0 -c:v libx265 -crf 51 -preset slow -vf scale="256:144" -ac 1 -c:a aac -ar 32k -aq 0.3 for f in *.*; do ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -n -i "$f" $default "remnants/$f"; done`
