I made this bash script to convert Youtube Videos into high quality GIFs, it uses yt-dlp, ffmpeg and gifski for this. The script downloads all the libraries automatically, downloads the youtube video, converts it into a gif file and then deletes the downloaded video. when it runs it starts by asking for the link, start time duration etc. So far i tested it in ubuntu 24.04 and macOS Sequoia and it works well on both. Haven't tried on WSL yet but it should work.
