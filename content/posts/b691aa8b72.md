The header says is all. I typed ld instead of ls. Nothing happened for a few seconds so I CTRL+C‘d. Then I remembered ld is the linker and I tried the usual to find out, if sth. happens, if you run it without any parameters, but it doesn’t look like. I now also get an error, if I just type ld. Is it normal that some tools take a little longer, if you execute them for the first time (I guess ld has been run before internally, hasn’t it)? Also, is it bad in anyway, if you cancel the first execution with an CTRL+C? Will you interrupt some kind of initialization?
