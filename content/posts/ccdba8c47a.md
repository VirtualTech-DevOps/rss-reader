Hi, I've created an encrypted-journaling command-line application inspired by [https://jrnl.sh](https://jrnl.sh) It is just a single bash script for the app, and another script for the setup. I wanted something that was dead simple, and something that does not have too many dependencies.

The idea is to use existing tools to just start writing, and have the records automatically arranged in a specified folder.

Please check out the project here: [https://github.com/nilz-bilz/cli-jrnl](https://github.com/nilz-bilz/cli-jrnl) and let me know if there are any changes or improvements you guys would like to see. I haven't yet tested this on mac and other Unix systems, so it would be great to get some feedback on those platforms as well. Thanks
