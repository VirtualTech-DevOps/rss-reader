Hey everyone, Wanted to introduce Pipet - it's a tool I made for quickly scraping and extracting data from websites, HTML or JSON. It leans heavily on existing UNIX idea, likes pipes and command line usage.

Pipet works with "pipet recipe files", for example:

    curl https://old.reddit.com/r/commandline/ div.entry a.title span.domain a li.first | sed -n 's/.*>\([0-9]\+\) comments<.*/\1/p' 

you just need to save this as a file and run it using `pipet FILE`. the above would use curl to fetch the page (you can use any curl arguments too, for example to add headers), then iterate over each item, and extract the title, the domain, and the comments - which it will run through sed to get the number only.

Pipet can do much more, like run a command when the data changes or output the data as JSON or using a template file.
