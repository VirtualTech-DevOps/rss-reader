I need to monitor the dynamic public IP of a Debian server at home and get notified when this IP changes.

A script using email or Telegram would work, but I’m looking for a P2P option without intermediaries; I just need a notification or message.

It's important that the application is open source, has an F-Droid client for Android, and doesn’t require an intermediary.

I’ve been trying TOX but haven't found a client that works properly from the command line. I need a simple script that should do the following:

Initial setup with TOX:

*   Display the QR code for the friend key for TRIfA on Android
*   Accept the friend request
*   Exit

Daily tasks:

*   Check if the IP has changed every 30 minutes
*   If the IP has changed, connect to the TOX network
*   Retry connection with the friend
*   If the friend is connected, send the new IP via TOX message
*   Close TOX connection

Thanks
