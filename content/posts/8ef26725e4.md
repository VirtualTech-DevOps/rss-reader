[![How to overwrite nerd font icons?](https://external-preview.redd.it/90A0-mkbXXxlgTx03pbX50ic0w5WF--uMWWfV8po1R4.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3b57dbcbd1dc5a61b8f50bbcd19629d6e7fcdedf "How to overwrite nerd font icons?")](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1gecr20/how_to_overwrite_nerd_font_icons/)

For instance, I want to replace the `nf-md-numeric_1_circle_outline` icon (you can search that in [https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) to see), with this Apple [SF Symbol](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) `1.circle` instead. I use a nerd font in Neovide (an Nvim GUI), where I can paste in the text character for `1.circle` and it shows correctly without additional steps. On [nerdfonts.com](https://nerdfonts.com), it says at the bottom "You can even specify a custom symbol font with the `--custom` option to include even more glyphs." but I didn't find any instructions for how exactly to make a font file with the glyphs I want. I want to be able to overwrite any nerd icon with one in the SF Symbols app.
