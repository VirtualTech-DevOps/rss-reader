I'm looking to sync my music library ongoing using rsync.

Local copy I maintain is well, local, and serverside is mounted locally via samba locally.

I would like to run a daily cron rsync to sync up the two folder, source will be local and I want the server to mirror it, including deletions/changes etc.

But I don't need permission n stuff, so not -a methinks.

I've tried a few option and an feeling a little lost. Some seem to mirror and delete but is rewriting all the files every time on my my tests.

Any ideas?

Also some syncs will likely take a few days, is have a daily cron job an issue with this?
