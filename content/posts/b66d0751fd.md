Hey! You might remember me from my last project QuickSched ([https://github.com/AndrewRoe34/quick-sched](https://github.com/AndrewRoe34/quick-sched)). It's an intelligent, dynamic personal scheduling tool that competes with the likes of Reclaim AI, which is considered one of the best scheduling tools in the market: [https://ibb.co/8Dbz1JD](https://ibb.co/8Dbz1JD)

I'm currently in the process of porting it all over to Go and working on a fresh TUI for it using Bubble Tea.

So, if you're interested in working on this open source project, leave a comment below :)
