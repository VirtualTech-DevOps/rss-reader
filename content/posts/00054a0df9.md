Hi everyone! I’m excited to share my first project in Go, a command-line tool called \`o\`. It helps you interact more seamlessly with your Obsidian vault directly from the terminal. You can create new notes, search through markdown files, and even open today’s daily note in your favorite text editor.

I started this project shortly after picking up Go, so I decided to use this as a pet project to learn Go, while also improving Quality of Life when it comes to taking notes in the command line (without too much re-inventing the wheel).

**Key features:**

*   **Today Command**: Opens today’s journal file for quick editing.
*   **File Search**: List and quickly select markdown files with fzf integration.
*   **New Command**: Create new notes quickly.

I love taking notes in Obsidian, but often found switching between the terminal and GUI a bit distracting, especially while deep in coding sessions. This tool is my solution to keep the workflow smooth from the terminal.

Since this is my first Go project, I would love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or any improvements you think could make it better. Any feedback, even if critical, is highly appreciated!
