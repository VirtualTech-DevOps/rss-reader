Hey r/commandline !

I just posted this blog post detailing parts of my Neovim setup and would love if possible to get your guys' feedback, advice, and/or critiques! I didn't touch upon all aspects of my setup but just the plugins, mappings, and options that are "must-haves" for me.

Looking forward to hearing from y'all!
