Hi,

I've always used freecommander and double commendare as orthodox file manager, but I feel both are slugghish compared to total commander.  
Since I want to stick with free sofware, can you advice a Terminal file manager that is good to learn on windows?  
Something that is modern and support font/icon like I see on linux :(

Thanks a lot in advance.
