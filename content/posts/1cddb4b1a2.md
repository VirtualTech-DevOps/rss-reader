Just hacked together a fun little terminal reader that lets you weave through books with vim-like navigation while chatting with them using AI.

Navigate like you're in vim: `h`/`l` between chapters, `j`/`k` to scroll, `g`/`G` to jump around â€” and arrows, ofc

*   `a`sk questions to the text - incl. references to sections, chapters, book & its metadata
*   `s`ummarize current section
*   `t`oggle toc
*   `r`ead passage
*   `q`uit whenever

And my favorite, press `>` for an AI narrator that situates you in the current scene/chapter.

Should work with any `.epub` file.

Built this because I wanted a more interactive way to "move" around books and go broad or deep in the text using an AI companion. And who knows, perhaps uncover insights hidden in some of these books.
