So I have the following .bat file that runs in CMD:

    cd C:\Users\xxxxx\AppData\Local\Programs\WinSCP winscp.exe /console /script="synctolocalscript.txt" /log=mylog.log" 

This opens a WINSCP cmd window that actually does the main part to pull some information. So this runs every minute on my PC, but the problem is that every minute I am getting 2 cmd windows popping open and running for about 10 seconds, then closing, so interrupts anything I am working on at the time.

I am still fairly green when it comes to scripting and cmd line stuff, so I am not sure how exactly to make this run silently. Do I do it in the initial cmd line bat file? The synctolocalscript.txt WINSCP file? Or Windows task scheduler where this is scehduled at?
