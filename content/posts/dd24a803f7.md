A topic up for discussion: For people who rely heavily on the command line (at least use it exclusively for code editing), do you think it's a good idea to do everything in the commandline?

I'm trying to build my entire workflow without leaving the terminal, but I can't get it right. Some of the tasks that I don't find good tools for:

*   DB clients with rich features (vim motions, autocompletion, history, .. etc)  
    
*   Task management  
    
*   Note taking  
    
*   Making API requests

Have you been able to move entirely to the terminal? Do you think it's a good idea to do so, or are there things that are better done in the GUI?
