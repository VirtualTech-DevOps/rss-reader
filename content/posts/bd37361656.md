rainfrog is a lightweight, terminal-based alternative to pgadmin/dbeaver. it features vim-like keybindings for navigation and query editing, shortcuts to preview rows/columns/indexes, and the ability to quickly traverse tables and schemas.

it primarily supports postgres, but there is also experimental/unstable support for mysql and sqlite!
