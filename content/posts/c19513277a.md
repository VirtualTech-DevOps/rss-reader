Hello folks, I have been trying to contribute to this called 18alantom/flex and the developer and I have been both discussing about shell widgets which both of us did not know about. But somehow the developer has implemented shell widgets for zsh and i was contributing for a fish implemention. Does anyone here know more about shell widgets? Apparently the developer of fzf has also made use of widgets in his codebase. (Check filename: key-bindings.fish in the codebase? Perhaps even the man page of fish or bash doesn't even have anything related to shell widgets.
