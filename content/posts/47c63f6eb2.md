Hi!

I've got a question regarding a problem I'm running into at work. I feel it in my bones that there should be a batch solution to this, but I genuinely don't know what command it would be. Perhaps someone here could point me to the right direction? Manually, this is taking hours and it will take many more hours.

I have location A with many maps named \[xzy\] with files inside. I want to transfer particular \[xyz\] maps to a different directory, but not all. I have the names of the to be transfered maps in a .txt file.

How do I get the maps from location A to location B?
