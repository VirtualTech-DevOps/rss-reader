I'm a Fish user and I'm thinking of switching to Bash, because I want to share scripts and commands with my team, they all have Bash installed. My Fish setup is pretty robust, I have Vi mode, `atuin` for command history, Fish command and argument name completions, syntax highlighting. I'm wondering, do you, people who run Bash on their machines daily, have a way for configuring Bash in a similar way? For what i searched and tried, [`ble.sh`](http://ble.sh) provides completions and highlightings, Vi mode is supported by Bash by default, and you can get `atuin` to work with `ble.sh`. But [`ble.sh`](http://ble.sh) feels kinda laggy and slow, and I don't really like it's Vi mode implementation (i can't even `ctrl-c` in there). Is there any alternatives?
