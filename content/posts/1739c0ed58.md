[r/bash](/r/bash) deleted my post instantly, so here i post.

I run minecraft on my laptop while linking the datafile to an smb share.

So every time I want to play, i need to mount said share, and THEN open the mc app. I created a script that does that for me automatically, but i see it returning a strange message.

i'm pretty much a noob in writing code, but i try my best replicating what i watch on ytüòÖ.

these are the two scripts i made

connectmc

    #!/bin/bash mkdir ~/Desktop/mclink ; mount_smbfs //user@server/Desktop ~/Desktop/mclink && echo Server Connected && open -a minecraft || echo Server Not Connected ; rmdir ~/Desktop/mclink 

ejectmc

    #!/bin/bash killall launcher ; sleep 5 umount ~/Desktop/mclink && rmdir ~/Desktop/mclink && echo Server Disconnected 

so, after all that introduction.

my connection script returns both a success message and an error to rmdir

can anyone tell my why im getting this?

     $ connectmc Server Connected rmdir: /Users/user/Desktop/mclink: Resource busy 

ejectmc works fine btwüòÅ!
