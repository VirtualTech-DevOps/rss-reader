If I were to take a snapshot of a git repo at a particular point in time, who would be the top contributors by active lines of code? And then, what type of files have they contributed the most? I've always been curious about this, so I built this little tool.

It uses \`git\` under the hood to obtain the information and it's nothing fancy, but keen to hear any thoughts/comments.

It's not packaged at the moment so you'll need rust to be able to run it. But can look into packaging it if there's interest.
