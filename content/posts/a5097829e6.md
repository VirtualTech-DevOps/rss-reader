\[Solved\] I have this music folder with many files, one of them having this filename "\[8BIT\] SOLIDMETAL \[b5SEorQ2wAE\].m4a". I only want to get "b5SEorQ2wAE" from this filename but nothing works.

This ID is required for yt-dlp to redownload the file into another folder. (I could copy the files instead, but this is a hypothetical, so let's not entertain that idea)

I tried really hard to find a solution, but I came up with no solutions that were ideal. Here's what works so far:

    for f in *.m4a; do mkdir retry id=${f%]*} id=${id#*[} id=${id#*[} id=${id#*[} yt-dlp $options $id -o retry/"$nameformat" done 

While this works, it doesn't account for the possibility that the file could be "\[8BIT\] \[SOLIDMETAL\] \[b5SEorQ2wAE\].m4a" or "\[8BIT\] \[DIETARYDRINK\] \[\[\[SOLIDMETAL\]\]\] \[b5SEorQ2wAE\].m4a". There are cases where it won't work as intended.

I entertained the idea of using .m4a as a guide of what to eliminate instead of just the \[\], or by starting the count from the end, say "give me character 6-16". But I couldn't find anything in bash that could do such thing. I also considered counting the amount of "\[" there are so I could for example do id=${id"$count"\*\[} where count would be \[=3\*#=### so id=${id###\*\[} but that is not possible with variable expansion I think.

As I write this post, I consider the genius idea of doing charcount-16=x y=charcount-5 giveme=x....y, but.... my search results say "count inside the file! that's what you want right?" and I just noped out -\_-. I am not dealing with these search results anymore.
