Imagine a casual weekend morning. After waking up from sleep, you hop into Reddit and see some insane linux desktop things on your feed. Maybe someone has created a brand new color palette, or maybe another one has invented a whole new way of using the desktop? Yup, that's the [r/unixporn](/r/unixporn) we all remember and were excited for.

Alright, I'll just come straight to the point now. What on earth has happened to this subreddit? I log on to reddit every twice a week and every damn time I get a bunch of semi-transparent terminal-filled screenshots shoved on my face. There's nothing new. It's always just a bunch of lazy-themed terminals and stuffs. Even worse, sometimes it's just the default!

The third rule of this sub says: "Defaults aren't permitted - A default post is defined as: close to zero changes to a DE/WM, including distro defaults and/or only changing a GTK theme, icon pack, or terminal color scheme to something premade". Ironically, this sub is now filled with near defaults. I believe that I'm not the only one here who was once always excited and waiting to see new stuffs going on this sub but is now, well, just wanna unsubscribe sometimes.

I do understand that approving near-default posts is crucial for keeping this sub alive, but this itself is contradictory to the existence of this sub. This sub has introduced me to what's possible with the freedom of linux. I really miss the then "unixporn"

This rant ends here.
