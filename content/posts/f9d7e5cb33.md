I'm backing up alot of files and wanted to keep a record of the files original dates. You can easily list all files in terminal using find and show the date created, modified etc but it's the MacOS extra one I'd also like entitled 'Date Added'.

For this your able to use mdls which does show you the **kMDItemDateAdded** attribute for non music or video files. For these, they simply don't have the attribute listed. However if I check the file in Finder there is a Date Added value clearly displayed. The date _is_ also different from the other dates so it's not just mirroring the created date say.

How do I get access to this from Terminal?
