HI all, I just released a IP bot detection and IP geolocation command line utility for IPDetective.

You can use it for free without an API key however you may be rate limited depending on the amount of requests you are making.

This tool should help you easily determine the amount of IP addresses that are bots (datacenter, botnet, proxy or VPN) and determine IP country of origin.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
