hi im trying to find a script to compare 2 directories full of audio files from a Visual novel  
and for it to only keep the audio files that the length/duration is longer

the file extension is .ogg  
the directories are  
$folder1 = "D:\\Newfolder3\\Newfolder\\test\\"  
$folder2 = "D:\\Newfolder3\\Newfolder2\\Newfolder\\test\\"

and for the story i made the fruit of grisaia patch for the steam  
but recently i found out some of the lines are cut off  
due to the censorship of the steam version  
so i have all the lines of the unrated version in 1 folder  
and the lines from the steam version in another  
the unrated would have the longer dialog  
hence if i have a script to automatically do this  
it would be a huge help since there are almost 25,000 audio files in each folder

update:  
i think i got a script that does the job with file size instead

    # Define the directories $dir1 = "D:\Newfolder3\pcm1\" $dir2 = "D:\Newfolder3\pcm2\" # Get the list of files in directory 1 Get-ChildItem -Path $dir1 | ForEach-Object { $file1 = $_ $file2 = Join-Path -Path $dir2 -ChildPath $file1.Name # Check if the corresponding file exists in directory 2 if (Test-Path -Path $file2) { # Get the file sizes $size1 = $file1.Length $size2 = (Get-Item $file2).Length # Compare sizes (100 KB = 102400 bytes) if ($size1 + 102400 -le $size2) { Write-Host "Deleting $($file1.FullName) (size: $size1 bytes) because $($file2) (size: $size2 bytes) is larger by at least 100 KB." Remove-Item -Path $file1.FullName -Force # Delete the file } } }
