hi im trying to find a script to compare 2 directories full of audio files from a Visual novel  
and for it to only keep the audio files that the length/duration is longer

the file extension is .ogg  
the directories are  
$folder1 = "D:\\Newfolder3\\Newfolder\\test\\"  
$folder2 = "D:\\Newfolder3\\Newfolder2\\Newfolder\\test\\"

and for the story i made the fruit of grisaia patch for the steam  
but recently i found out some of the lines are cut off  
due to the censorship of the steam version  
so i have all the lines of the unrated version in 1 folder  
and the lines from the steam version in another  
the unrated would have the longer dialog  
hence if i have a script to automatically do this  
it would be a huge help since there are almost 25,000 audio files in each folder

i have a script but it doesn't work

[this script might need FFmpeg](https://www.mediafire.com/file/r7jpavcljald9it/duration_compare.bat/file)
