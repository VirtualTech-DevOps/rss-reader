**TLDR**: I used to obsess over and spend lots of time on software lists when trying to improve my desktop workflow, but after seeing how many different ones I would stop using after a while, I have stopped obsessing. Awesome lists are still good for getting a taste of an ecosystem but don't let them overwhelm you.

Awesome lists like those found on Github for a specific OS, programming language, or other software / ecosystem. For instance: [https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim).

I've done lots of thinking and work on my desktop workflow (trying to use my computer more efficiently) and came across them a lot. With my tendency to overthink and perfectionism, I would thoroughly read awesome lists to make sure I consider every single option for apps or software plugins, leading to dozens of tabs open to look through one by one. I wouldn't have time to read through all of them so I would make a bunch of bookmark folders, and sometimes I would open the lists over and over again to make sure I don't miss anything. I would have the feeling that I'm missing or one piece of software away from significantly improving my workflow which is why I thought I should keep going. Basically FOMO.

Eventually I thought enough is enough. Now I think awesome lists are enough to quickly see what software is out there that might benefit you, and its easy to fall into the trap of overthinking since the lists tend to be extremely long. And it's common to have lots of things on the list that do the same thing / significantly overlap in functionality. They seem to prioritize quantity over quality, sometimes consisting largely of repos with no more than a few or few dozen stars and little documentation. Over time I learned to not obsess over software so much, especially after realizing how many different apps and plugins I've dropped over time.
