1.  **Achieve zero-downtime deployment using just your** `.env` **and** `Dockerfile`
    *   Docker-Blue-Green-Runner's [run.sh](http://run.sh/) script is designed to simplify deployment: "With your `.env`, project, and a single Dockerfile, simply run 'bash run.sh'." This script covers the entire process from Dockerfile build to server deployment from scratch.
    *   This means you can easily migrate to another server with just the files mentioned above.
    *   In contrast, Traefik requires the creation and gradual adjustment of various configuration files, which requires your App's docker binary running.
2.  **No unpredictable errors in reverse proxy and deployment : Implement safety measures to handle errors caused by your app or Nginx**
    *   If any error occurs in the app or router, `deployment is halted` to prevent any impact on the existing deployment
        *   Internal Integrity Check:
        *   Nginx Router Test Container
        *   External Integrity Check
        *   Nginx Contingency Plan
        *   Rollback Procedures
        *   Additional Know-hows on Docker: Tips and best practices for optimizing your Docker workflow and deployment processes
    *   For example, Traefik offers powerful dynamic configuration and service discovery; however, certain errors, such as a failure to detect containers (due to issues like unrecognized certificates), can lead to frustrating 404 errors that are hard to trace through logs alone.

    *   Manipulates NGINX configuration files directly to ensure container accessibility. It also tests configuration files by launching a test NGINX Docker instance, and if an NGINX config update via Consul-Template fails, Contingency Plan provided is activated to ensure connectivity to your containers.
3.  **Track Blue-Green status and the Git SHA of your running container for easy monitoring.**
    *   Blue-Green deployment decision algorithm: scoring-based approach
    *   Run the command bash [check-current-status.sh](http://check-current-status.sh/) (similar to `git status`) to view all relevant details

5.  **Production Deployment**
    *   Refer to the [Production Deployment](https://github.com/patternhelloworld/docker-blue-green-runner#production-deployment) section
