[![Navita - A new directory navigation tool](https://external-preview.redd.it/BVkNtfI-DyVZvhLXLRX3-q603mBpuLgxNnoEf_mYm-c.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=148200f303b33bb512313712ae05e2a87ca16439 "Navita - A new directory navigation tool")](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1fhecb9/navita_a_new_directory_navigation_tool/)

[Navita](https://github.com/CodesOfRishi/navita) is a Bash/Zsh utility for rapid directory traversal, employing fuzzy matching, history tracking, and path validation for efficient file system navigation.

Here's a demo of **Navita**:

**I'm seeking feedback from the public as Navita approaches its first release.** I was initially inspired by [Enhancd](https://github.com/babarot/enhancd), which lead me to developing [SmartCD](https://github.com/CodesOfRishi/smartcd). Taking some free time and reviewing SmartCD again after 2 years, I saw multiple opportunities of improving the code and at the same time large chunk of my own code was not making sense to me at first glance, realizing I may have overcomplicated it.. lol. So I decided to implement everything from scratch.

Please share your ideas for improvements or report any issues on the GitHub repository.
