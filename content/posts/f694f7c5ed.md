I just wrote a TUI for managing BibLaTeX files from the terminal: [bibiman](https://codeberg.org/lukeflo/bibiman); and would be happy if somebody finds it useful.

But why this _yet another programm_ approach? There are already some similar projects out there, like [bibman](https://codeberg.org/KMIJPH/bibman), [papis](https://github.com/papis/papis), [cobib](https://gitlab.com/cobib/cobib) or [bib.ask](https://github.com/huijunchen9260/bib.awk).

No question, all of them are great tools focusing on bib management with different main aspects.

So is `bibiman`:

My main focus is on **accessibility**, **simplicity** and **speed**. It should be easy to find an entry fast, perform an action and resume your scientific work. E.g. open the TUI, select a keyword to filter the entries and then filter it further by fast fuzzy searching. As soon as the needed entry is selected, just copy the citekey or open the corresponding PDF, and exit...

Thus, I decided to write `bibiman` in Rust which provides the needed speed.

The main actions are:

*   Filtering by keywords
*   Fuzzy searching entries and/or keywords
*   Yanking the citekey to system clipboard
*   Opening the `.bib` file at the selected entry for editing
*   Opening corresponding PDF
*   Opening corresponding DOI/URL

I plan to implement some more actions connecting entries with notes. But since _simplicity_ is one main goal, it might never get as many features as some of the mentioned alternatives. For example, editing entries can be easily done from you editor. Thus, `bibiman` only opens the editor at the correct position. An in-TUI editing is not planned.

If someone here has some ideas or just an opinion, I'm happy for a comment. If not, its also fine :D
