[![Cluster size not displaying](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YTioR0409HmIndfMvsxZL05gVQq1OsmnbQwZ9LwPo5w.jpg "Cluster size not displaying")](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1fw2tp7/cluster_size_not_displaying/)

I am in the process of learning a bit more command line and I'm stumped on this one.

When I try to execute the command fsutil fsinfo volumeinfo D: , it doesn't show my cluster size. I have tried running it in an elevated prompt, I've rebooted, I've used two different drives - none of them are showing the cluster size.

No matter how much digging I do, I cannot figure out exactly why the cluster size is not showing.

Thanks in advance!
