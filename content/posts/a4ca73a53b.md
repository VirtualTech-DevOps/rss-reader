It was only the other day I did more research on which TUI file explorer to start using, then decided to use Yazi, and I'm already falling in love with it. It has lots of features and great documentation, though I still need to use Finder on Mac since I couldn't find a TUI explorer that can show a grid of photos. I'm trying to use Yazi whenever I can but I do need to quickly glance at image files often.
