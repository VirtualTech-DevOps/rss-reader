Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I was bored and decided to whip up a **2048 game** that runs right in the terminal. It only took me about an hour to make, and I had fun adding:

*   **Centering** for a neat layout.
*   **Boxed grid** for structure.
*   **Colors and blinking tiles** to make it more lively.

If you're curious, the source code is available on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/GochiStuff/2048-The-Next-Move-ASCII-GAME-).

Feel free to try it out, suggest improvements, or fork it to make your own version! ðŸ˜Š

PS: Use WASD to move, Q to select, and E to switch. Press F to exit the game.
