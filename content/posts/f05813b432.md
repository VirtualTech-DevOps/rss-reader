Corrected title: How to check what variable is being used by variable? (bash) / How the hell did I miss that up so bad.

I need to check if in one variable, the value uses the variable type1 or type2.

These are the variables `Type1="Acorn" Typo2="Fuego" Message="${Type} water"`

Sometimes power uses type2. This is what I need

\`\`\` If \[ "${message}" == _"Type"_ \]; then runs commands to prepare flavored water elif \[ "${message}" == _"Typo"_ \]; then runs commands to prepare spicy flavored water fi

echo "${message}" \`\`\`

As you can see there's a problem. Echo needs to expand type for it to work, but the if needs to keep it as a literal string. Is there are any way I can, unexpand or force an expansion without changing the variable message?

I had been testing this with echo. I personally think there is no way to do this and I should seek other approaches, I did this in the comment I left here, but I prefer to not workaround.
