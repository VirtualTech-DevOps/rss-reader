Hi guys,

I've been trying to spend a bit more time in the command line because I know it's efficient, but I'm struggling to get fast enough with it to justify sticking.

Here are some examples of things i do that I need to optimize in cli:

1) I'm a photographer, so I often get to my machine with 2 or 3 memory cards full of images, sometimes from different days. I want to be able to open the card, copy all the files taken on a particular date into another folder on another HDD, rename the folder etc.  
2) General file management like above. I'm often in a folder with many different files and filetypes, and I need to be able to copy a group of files to somewhere else, potentially creating the destination folder in the process.  
3) I need to be able to make selections of large groups of files in a folder, either by format or date.  
4) I'd like to be able to get a quick look at the external disks mounted and navigate to them.  
I'd also

If you guys could share with me how you do these things, that would be great.

I'm happy to use things like fzf and zoxide to help, but it seems like there are so many ways to complete these tasks.
