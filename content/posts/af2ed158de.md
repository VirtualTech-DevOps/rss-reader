Termfu is my take on a multi-language TUI debugger that allows you to create and switch between custom layouts. All window data is scrollable. Breakpoints and watchpoints persist between sessions. It currently supports GDB and PDB. Header command order, window size and position, (t)itle strings, and key bindings are customizable.
