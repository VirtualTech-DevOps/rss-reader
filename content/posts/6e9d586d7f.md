I've been thinking about having my terminal launch neovim in terminal mode, with my shell set in neovim, rather than having the terminal launch the shell whenever it starts up or opens new tabs. Basically vim terminal as a daily driver, so I can write terminal commands directly using Vim motions. I've looked this up for existing thoughts and discussions but didn't find any.
