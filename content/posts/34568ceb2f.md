Hello all,

At my workplace we have dozens of Kubernetes clusters to manage through many CSPs and some hosted on site. We share the commands in our wiki and everyone is storing the commands in their own way. I wanted to create a curses style command line tool that offers a clean interaction to select the command and be able to quickly share this with the team.

Are there any templates or frameworks to start with before I create something from scratch?

Thanks in advance!
