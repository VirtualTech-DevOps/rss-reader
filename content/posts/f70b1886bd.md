Since a lot goes into scheduling, I'll be showing how a typical weekly planner is created with QuickSched.

Here are our Tasks/Activities for the upcoming week:

    > task ------------------------------------------ TASKS ------------------------------------------ ID | NAME | CARD | HOURS | DUE | ARCHIVED -----|---------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|--------- 0 | Math homework | Math | 2.5 | 23-10-2024 | No 1 | Science lab report | Science | 3.0 | 25-10-2024 | No 2 | Read literature | Literature | 1.5 | 24-10-2024 | No 3 | History essay | History | 4.0 | 26-10-2024 | No 4 | Revise math test | Math | 3.5 | 28-10-2024 | No 5 | Science experiment | Science | 2.0 | 23-10-2024 | No 6 | Draft lit paper | Literature | 2.5 | 24-10-2024 | No 7 | Review history | History | 1.0 | 29-10-2024 | No 8 | study ch3 | Math | 5.5 | 27-10-2024 | No 

And here are our weekly timeblocks (i.e. events):

    > event ------------------------------------------ RECURRING EVENTS ------------------------------------------ ID | NAME | CARD | TIME | DAYS -----|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------- 3 | Lunch | - | 12:00pm-01:00pm | MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI 5 | Art Workshop | - | 01:00pm-04:00pm | FRI 2 | Literature Study | Literature | 02:00pm-04:00pm | MON, WED 1 | Science Lab | Science | 01:00pm-03:00pm | TUE, THU 0 | History Lecture | History | 10:00am-12:00pm | TUE, THU 4 | Math Class | Math | 10:00am-12:00pm | MON, WED, FRI 

With QuickSched, you can quickly generate an entire schedule that will schedule our Tasks around our timeblocks/events (all while following our preferred working hours for the week and each day):

    > sched ------------------------------------------ SCHEDULE ------------------------------------------ DATE: 23-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ E.ID: 4 | Math Class | Math | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm E.ID: 3 | Lunch | - | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm E.ID: 2 | Literature Study | Literature | 2.0 hrs | 02:00pm-04:00pm T.ID: 0 | Math homework | Math | 2.5 hrs | 04:00pm-06:30pm T.ID: 5 | Science experiment | Science | 2.0 hrs | 06:30pm-08:30pm DATE: 24-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ E.ID: 0 | History Lecture | History | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm E.ID: 3 | Lunch | - | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm E.ID: 1 | Science Lab | Science | 2.0 hrs | 01:00pm-03:00pm T.ID: 6 | Draft lit paper | Literature | 2.5 hrs | 03:00pm-05:30pm T.ID: 2 | Read literature | Literature | 1.5 hrs | 05:30pm-07:00pm T.ID: 1 | Science lab report | Science | 1.0 hrs | 07:00pm-08:00pm DATE: 25-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ E.ID: 4 | Math Class | Math | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm E.ID: 3 | Lunch | - | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm E.ID: 5 | Art Workshop | - | 3.0 hrs | 01:00pm-04:00pm T.ID: 1 | Science lab report | Science | 2.0 hrs | 04:00pm-06:00pm T.ID: 3 | History essay | History | 2.0 hrs | 06:00pm-08:00pm DATE: 26-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ T.ID: 3 | History essay | History | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm T.ID: 8 | study ch3 | Math | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm DATE: 27-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ [ERROR] Task 8 is short by 4.5 DATE: 28-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ E.ID: 4 | Math Class | Math | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm E.ID: 3 | Lunch | - | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm T.ID: 4 | Revise math test | Math | 1.0 hrs | 01:00pm-02:00pm E.ID: 2 | Literature Study | Literature | 2.0 hrs | 02:00pm-04:00pm T.ID: 4 | Revise math test | Math | 2.5 hrs | 04:00pm-06:30pm T.ID: 7 | Review history | History | 0.5 hrs | 06:30pm-07:00pm DATE: 29-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ E.ID: 0 | History Lecture | History | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm E.ID: 3 | Lunch | - | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm E.ID: 1 | Science Lab | Science | 2.0 hrs | 01:00pm-03:00pm T.ID: 7 | Review history | History | 0.5 hrs | 03:00pm-03:30pm 

This was the resulting schedule created as per our tasks, timeblocks, and provided daily/weekly hours. The error that you're seeing for Oct 27 is due me preferring 0 hours on Sunday.

Now, just by adjusting the settings to allow 8 hour days throughout the entire week, here's the resulting change (starting hour was adjusted to demonstrate how everything is altered dynamically):

    > sched ------------------------------------------ SCHEDULE ------------------------------------------ DATE: 23-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ E.ID: 4 | Math Class | Math | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm E.ID: 3 | Lunch | - | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm E.ID: 2 | Literature Study | Literature | 2.0 hrs | 02:00pm-04:00pm T.ID: 0 | Math homework | Math | 2.5 hrs | 04:00pm-06:30pm T.ID: 5 | Science experiment | Science | 2.0 hrs | 06:30pm-08:30pm T.ID: 6 | Draft lit paper | Literature | 2.0 hrs | 08:30pm-10:30pm DATE: 24-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ T.ID: 2 | Read literature | Literature | 1.5 hrs | 07:00am-08:30am T.ID: 6 | Draft lit paper | Literature | 0.5 hrs | 08:30am-09:00am T.ID: 1 | Science lab report | Science | 1.0 hrs | 09:00am-10:00am E.ID: 0 | History Lecture | History | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm E.ID: 3 | Lunch | - | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm E.ID: 1 | Science Lab | Science | 2.0 hrs | 01:00pm-03:00pm T.ID: 1 | Science lab report | Science | 2.0 hrs | 03:00pm-05:00pm T.ID: 3 | History essay | History | 3.0 hrs | 05:00pm-08:00pm DATE: 25-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ T.ID: 3 | History essay | History | 1.0 hrs | 07:00am-08:00am T.ID: 8 | study ch3 | Math | 2.0 hrs | 08:00am-10:00am E.ID: 4 | Math Class | Math | 2.0 hrs | 10:00am-12:00pm E.ID: 3 | Lunch | - | 1.0 hrs | 12:00pm-01:00pm E.ID: 5 | Art Workshop | - | 3.0 hrs | 01:00pm-04:00pm T.ID: 8 | study ch3 | Math | 3.5 hrs | 04:00pm-07:30pm T.ID: 4 | Revise math test | Math | 1.5 hrs | 07:30pm-09:00pm DATE: 26-10-2024 ------------------------------------------ T.ID: 4 | Revise math test | Math | 2.0 hrs | 07:00am-09:00am T.ID: 7 | Review history | History | 1.0 hrs | 09:00am-10:00am 

QuickSched allows you to control how spread out or compact you'd like your schedule to be :)
