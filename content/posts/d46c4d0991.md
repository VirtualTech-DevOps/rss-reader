*   I'm wondering if there is some CLI tool that outputs a recursive overview of a directory structure to STDOUT
*   But instead of a mostly "linear" layout as `/usr/bin/tree` outputs, I'd want it to make use of horizontal space to show sub-items rightward, like a mindmap...
    *   [Example of this style of layout from a GUI (FreePlane)...](https://i.imgur.com/bzZMcho.png)
*   Obviously it would usually need a flag like `tree -L 3` to limit depth to be usable with this style of output (or ideally it detects terminal width, and cuts off on its own)
*   I'm interested to hear about commands for any OS. Something that works on both Linux + native Windows would be ideal.
