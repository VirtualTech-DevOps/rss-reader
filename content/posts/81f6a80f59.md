Hello,

I have started development of TUI (using Textual) client for Transmission torrent daemon - **Tewi**.

Project page: [https://github.com/anlar/tewi](https://github.com/anlar/tewi)

It is in early stage of development but supports basic features to interact with Transmission:

*   Connects to local and remote daemon
*   View torrents and their details
*   Torrent actions: start/pause, remove/trash, verify, enable/disable speed limits
*   Show session details

Feel free to submit ideas or issues.
