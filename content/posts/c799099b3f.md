I am trying to create a symbolic link so that I can play The Sims 4 without my C drive running out of space (I use mods and Custom Content). I've done this already but created a link to my OneDrive on my D Drive. OneDrive sent a notification stating they would delete everything in my drive if I didn't upgrade. So, I moved the file out of my OneDrive. Now I am trying to create a symbolic link again and cannot figure it out for the life of me! Here is what I'm typing and the error messages I'm getting:

C:\\Windows\\System32>MKLINK /J "C:\\Users\\ringo\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Electronic Arts""D:\\Electronic Arts\\Saved The Sims 4"

The syntax of the command is incorrect.

Creates a symbolic link.

MKLINK \[\[/D\] | \[/H\] | \[/J\]\] Link Target

/D Creates a directory symbolic link. Default is a file

symbolic link.

/H Creates a hard link instead of a symbolic link.

/J Creates a Directory Junction.

Link Specifies the new symbolic link name.

Target Specifies the path (relative or absolute) that the new link

refers to.
