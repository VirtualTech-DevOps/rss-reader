So what im wanting to is to have a file appear a certain way but when opened it should go to another file which can be different.

Im not all that knowledgeable about such but i though that this might be a good place to ask.

My idea is something like a mount point or a symlink.

Would the knowledgebase around here have any ideas of how to solve this?

Background: Space Marine 2 modding has been restricted by the use of size checks on the pak files, not the right size and the game wont run as expected.

Some of the modders have managed to get the size of single mods right down to the byte but it is tedious and makes combining different mods very hard or even impossible.

Changing some config flags from True to False is obviously making the file larger due to the words containing a letter more.

Right now im hoping to combine a FoV mod with another that allows for holstered weapons to be show on the model but the implemented limitation makes it not work.
