Hello CLI Enthusiasts! üëã I'm excited to share **Mac Storage Manager**, a shell script built for macOS to help users reclaim disk space through the command line. üéØ

üìã Features:
============

*   **Size Analysis**: Retrieves and calculates sizes for:
    *   Homebrew formulas and casks.
    *   Apps in `/Applications` and `~/Applications`.
    *   (Optional) All apps using `sudo find`.
*   **Interactive Deletion**: Use a GUI (via `whiptail`) to select apps for removal.
*   **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Includes options to delete associated files like:
    *   Caches, Logs, Preferences, and Application Support.
*   **User Experience**:
    *   Progress bars during operations.
    *   Detailed logging for every action.
