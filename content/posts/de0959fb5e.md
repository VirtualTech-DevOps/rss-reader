(correct me if I'm wrong about any of this)

As far as I know shell programming languages don't have as large standard libraries (or whatever the equivalent is of if you can even call it an stdlib) than full-blown programming languages. Extra functionality would be imported via libraries, but shell scripts usually call binaries of installed packages to do complex tasks. I forget where but I read that in a Python program, it's faster to call youtube-dl (or now yt-dlp perhaps) from its Python library than call and pass commands through a shell command inside Python. Same with FFmpeg and its C API. Don't binaries have overhead of spawning and killing process?
