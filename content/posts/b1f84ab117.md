This might be much to ask but I basically want youtube in the terminal, to be able to search for videos and see thumbnails, as well as view all the stats like views, likes, upload date, and comments. I looked at yt-fzf but all it can do is view videos, and I can't copy video URLs. I looked at yewtube and it doesn't support search thumbnails, and neither does invidtui. Using more than one terminal tool for youtube would just be less efficient than just watching them on youtube.com.
