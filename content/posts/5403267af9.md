Has anyone tried this to quickly open photos on their current dir?

    fzf --preview 'display {}' 

Reqs: `imagemagick`and `fzf`packages

I like it. I'm no fzf expert, but this is the quickest way for me to open an image without having to rely on `chafa`(too slow and well... lo-fi).

My current issue is that when I select an entry from fzf, it loses focus to the image which is "previewed" with imagemagick. I need to "alt-tab" back into the terminal and select another entry on the list. Anyone knows a better way to do this?

Thanks!
