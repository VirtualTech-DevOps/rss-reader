I built a CLI dev toolkit, mostly for fun but also to automate repetitive tasks for my day job. It currently consists of 32 sub commands across these categories:

     | command | description | |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------| | aid http | HTTP functions | | aid ip | IP information / scanning | | aid port | Port information / scanning | | aid cpu | System cpu information | | aid mem | System memory information | | aid disk | System disk information | | aid network | System network information | | aid json | JSON parsing / extraction functions | | aid csv | CSV search / transformation functions | | aid text | Text manipulation functions | | aid file | File info functions | | aid time | Time related functions | | aid bits | Bit manipulation functions | | aid math | Math functions | 

I hope others might find it useful! Feedback / ideas are highly appreciated!
