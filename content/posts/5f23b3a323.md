I just tried Linux for the first time a month ago and instantly fell in love. It got me regretting not having moved to Linux sooner and I realized all the reasons that've been holding me back were unfounded. All the games I play just works, where I'm even getting higher FPS on triple A titles. All the apps I use for work, Photoshop, the Affinity Suite of apps, etc. all just work with a simple bash install script you can find with a quick Google or YouTube search.

And I figured since I could customize everything, why not try customizing everything lmao. I'd love to hear some thoughts, please don't be too harsh, I'm still new to all this and this rice is just me monke brain Googling what packages people use for what, installing and configuring.
