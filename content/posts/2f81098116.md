Hi,

I'm a CS student and deciding what side project to do in the next winter break. The project shall be something other peoples actually use and I'm willing to invest time and a low amount of money. Therefore I have to validate ideas before building.

One of the first problems to solve in my mind is a open source github like local markdown renderer to HTML. It seems to be a unsolved problem, at least the local part. There is a tool named grip but it's limted by the github ratelimit. On the other hand there are browser extensions and IDE's that already do this very well. The main point is that the renderer would be accessible via unix cli. Other applications could use it therefore without relying on a proprietary service.

How often do you use markdown and what features?

What features would you love to see?

How often do you use services for rendering markdown?

Hypothetical: How much would your employer pay for it?

Am I missing something?

I would be really interested in any insights!
