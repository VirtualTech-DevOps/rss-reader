I am just getting into \`remind\` as a calendar app and I am really liking it. It is satisfying my need to do stuff in the terminal. I am a long term \`todo.txt\` user and have been wanting a solution for calendar events.

Currently, I sync my todo.txt file between my laptop and android so that I have full access on both platforms, and it is working great. I use \`topydo\` on my laptop and \`simpletask\` on my android.

I would like to do a similar thing for my calendar events. The laptop is covered with \`remind\` and \`wyrd\`. But I don't know how to sync the data to my android phone. I am thinking maybe one approach would be to somehow sync the data using caldav to get it to my nextcloud server. From there, I could use any number of android apps.

I have come across two potential caldav oprions: [radicale-remind](https://github.com/jspricke/radicale-remind) and [remind-caldav](https://github.com/jspricke/remind-caldav). They are both python tools, and getting them installed on my NixOS system has me stumped, so before I spend a lot of time trying to get them installed, I am wondering if anyone has a two-way-sync solution for calendar events between desktop and android, preferably utilizing caldav?
