What My project Does:
=====================

PAR YT2Text Based on "yt" By Daniel Miessler with the addition of OpenAI Whisper for videos that don't have transcripts.

Whats New:
==========

*   Added support for local whisper model to transcribe audio

Key Features:
=============

*   Extract metadata, transcripts, and comments from YouTube videos
*   If the transcript is not available, optionally use OpenAI Whisper API or Local model to transcribe the audio

GitHub and PyPI
===============

*   Check out the project on GitHub or for full documentation, installation instructions, and to contribute: [https://github.com/paulrobello/par\_yt2text](https://github.com/paulrobello/par_yt2text)
*   PyPI [https://pypi.org/project/par\_yt2text/](https://pypi.org/project/par_yt2text/)

Comparison:
===========

I have seem many command line applications that pull YouTube transcripts and some that transcribe Youtube audio, but none that try to get the transcript first then fall back to auto transcription and also have API / local model options for audio transcription.

Target Audience
===============

AI enthusiasts and people that dont have enough time to watch 100's of video blogs a day.
