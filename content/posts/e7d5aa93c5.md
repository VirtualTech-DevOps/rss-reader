Hey hey,

I have some ubuntu machines and i use the google ecosystem since many years. Sometimes i think of things i want to remember, when i'm sitting at a terminal. What would be the easiest way to get a note on to the google ecosystem (or in worst case, some other cloud/server service) ?

I don't really need to read what is already there, but i would like to put something on to the stack, if you see what i mean. I can later review and edit/compile the notes, from a desktop machine.

NB: these are headless machines i am SSH:ing into.
