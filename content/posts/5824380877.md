I never developed CLI apps, and was wondering do terminal emulators provide some kind of universal technical standard when it comes to software development? Meaning, is there some specification a developer needs to follow in order for his binaries to be working inside a terminal emulator? Like there are frameworks for building GUI apps, are software terminals (among other things) one of a interface paradigms for developing apps?
