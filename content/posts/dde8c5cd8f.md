I'm trying to create a list of all of the file names in a folder with many many files. I've tried using "Dir > filenames.txt" but it's including columns for mode, LastWriteTime, Length, and Name. I only want the Name column. What would I write in the prompt? This is my first time even using the cmd function so thanks in advance for speaking to me like I am your grandmother. I look forward to making my life easier with the command line! Thanks!
