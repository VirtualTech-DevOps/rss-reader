Looking for a tool like Zoxide but without frecency/ambiguity, any ideas?

What I don't like about Zoxide is that it depends on frecency, which means it allows the possibility of going to the wrong directory (similar name, but just happens to be less frequently accessed so you jumped into the more frequent directory). You can `Space TAB` to show the candidates and select the right one, but IMO this should be done automatically where `z downloads ENTER` prompts you for the candidates `/tmp/downloads ~/downloads`. The user should not need to be conscious of whether there are multiple candidates named `downloads` to _know_ to `Space TAB` for candidates in order to select the right one.

Nicknames for directories should be supported, e.g. `tdown` for `/tmp/downloads` and `hdown` for `~/downloads`\--this both serves to require less keystrokes for matching and to reduce ambiguity. I've seen people happily create aliases for different directories but I would rather not pollute the alias scope and it's wouldn't scale well.

Zsh completions should be supported--this is the biggest hurdle for me to try to implement my own solution since it doesn't seem so straightforward briefly looking at the docs.

I've seen some alternatives that use things like `cdpath` and `hash -d` but it doesn't seem like an optimal solution because they affect the environment.

Hoping someone has similar ideas and implemented something I can do the same or tweak from.
