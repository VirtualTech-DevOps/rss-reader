[![[Hyprland] Kinda proud of my first ricing.](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/MZ5Wh2dWDZXnCiDApD1Nd6gACuA4gX5n9RH1QWVNISU.jpg "[Hyprland] Kinda proud of my first ricing.")](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1gepvvn/hyprland_kinda_proud_of_my_first_ricing/)

I'm very proud of my waybars. It's the only thing I'm proud of and kinda only thing I did(I do have a cool lockscreen but it doesn't screenshot that"

On the top waybar on the left there are kanji letters that shows workspaces I'm using. In the middle there is hr/min/sec(current time) on the right are buttons for configuring bluetooth, wifi and sound.

On the bottom of the waybar, there are monitoring stuff. On the left I can see my upload and download speed, if my vpn is on, and things like signal, total rx and tx and latency. In the middle there is system uptime. On the right there is CPU usage, memory usage, CPU temp and battery.

If anybody has any suggestions or tips, please comment it. I am in need of help from the masters of ricing.

If there are any other part of the desktop you wanna see comment it. I'll send a screenshot.

I use a thinkpad btw.
