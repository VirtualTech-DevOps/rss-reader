(MacOS 10.15.7 if it matters)

I recently got a VPN and to activate it after rebooting my computer i have to load the .conf file with Wireguard using the command "`sudo wg-quick up ./configfile.conf`", and then i have to enter my password.

I would like to create a script that does this for me so i don't have to type it all in the Terminal every time I start my Mac. However, when I run the script it obviously still asks for my password. What can I put in the script that will bypass that?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me with my beginner question, I'm new to this stuff but I'm excited to learn!
