Hello!

I got bored with having to manually refresh my web browser when working on 'vanilla-js' projects, so I wrote wd-41. What it does is that it statically hosts files, then injects a javascript script into html pages which establishes a websocket connection to the cli-process. Then, whenever file changes are detected, the browser is told to refresh the page via the websocket.

It works for any html file, so it's completely framework agnostic. Also written in Go. I hope it's helpful for you!
