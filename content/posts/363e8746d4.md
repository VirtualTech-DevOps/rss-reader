Basically I want to run a powercfg command but I want to activate a diff window to see if it only 'runs' when it is active (I suspect certain programs keeping system awake when they are selected/focused program, but want to be sure)

So how would I run (for example) a powercfg -requests command but have it 'wait' 5 seconds before it runs?

Thanks in advance.
