Hi everyone! I made a cli program that opens the rgb cube and displays its colors in a specific net, the amount of colors or the net type is defined by the user. Alternatively, the program can show colors with hex code and organized with the hsl parameters. I thought it was interesting visualization so I decided to share. What do you guys think about? Any suggestion of features that I should implement? Feedbacks are welcome!
