What is a command and what are options in this sequence `git push origin main`?

AFAIK, commands that are not Shell-integrated have their own binaries, meaning that `git` command should have its binary executable file, making it also a CLI program and not "pure" command.

Starting from this, is `git push` another separate command/program with its own binaries? Or `push` is an option that was programmed to be passed without the dash character?

I guess `origin` is an option? But it's also passed without the dash character.
