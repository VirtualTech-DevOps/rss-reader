Hi everyone,

I'm trying to convert a technical drawing in PDF format into a DXF that can be laser cut.

I tried \* inkscape: produces only empty output files \* pstoedit: crashes with a 'assertion failed. Core dumped' error \* pdf2svg and then magick from svg to dxf. But the resulting file can't be opened in lightburn.

Any help would be appreciated.
