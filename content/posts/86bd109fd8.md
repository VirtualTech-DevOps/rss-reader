so i went to try tmux, wondered why default shortcuts doesn't work, found out that it uses asciiville config, which i forgot that i installed a while back ago

anyway, understood the binds in the config and used it according to that config, however, when i try to delete a whole word using c-backspace (which is set in .zshrc itself, not in the terminal), it doesn't work

tried unbinding, rebinding C-BSpace to ^H, etc, nothing worked

tried \`cat\` and pressed c-backpace, and nothing printed, usually when i'm outside of tmux, it prints \`^H\`

here is the tmux config
