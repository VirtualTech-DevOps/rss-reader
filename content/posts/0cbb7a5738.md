I am building this in linux command line (bash scripting). Don't give me advice on why I should not do this there. :) I love to bash.

Here's how the script shall work:

*   input is job description; a wall of text
    
*   the api processes keywords listed there
    
*   It suggests those keywords to my bash script
    
*   My bash script shall take that keywords and convert my latex resume to tailor the job.
    

This is not done to "get a job"(I already have one), This is really done as a fun project to pass my boring time(poor guys is at home during holidays while the world travels).
