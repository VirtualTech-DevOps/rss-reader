Could anybody explain, in which directory (or directories) I should place my own shell scripts and configuation files on macOS?

*   `/usr/local/bin/`?
*   `/usr/local/etc/`?
*   `$HOME/bin/`?
*   `$HOME/etc/`?
*   ... ?

A best practice or a most common way?

Example files are:

*   `webpage2pdf.zsh` - an ImageMagick script to convert a webpage to PDF
*   `.webpage2pdf` - a configuration file for it
*   `.zshrc_my-own` - a Zsh cofiguration file that is sourced in my `~/.zshrc` using `source`, as suggested by Gilles to avoid accidental overridings: [https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/787409](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/787409)
