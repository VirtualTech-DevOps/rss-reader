I must be missing something, but it doesn't seem so straightforward to prevent wget/curl from overwriting existing file it downloads. It's more straightforward to provide a custom name for the resulting file, but I want to keep the resulting file's extension and possibly rename rest of the filename.

I see `curl` has the `--no-clobber` option, but I would like to be prompted or exit with error if there's an existing file of that name instead of downloading it with a suffix added (it's important that I know whether the existing file of the same name is actually downloaded from this source and not elsewhere where the latter could mean it's a different file that happens to have the same name, which _shouldn't_ be overwitten).

I think the key part is wanting to preserve the suffix of the resulting file name and a way to get the resulting filename before download.
