I basically print "\\x1b\[?1049h" to create a scrollback buffer, and then print something pretty big, I can't scroll up, when I print "\\x1b\[?1049l" I leave it and everything's back to normal, but inside it I just can't scroll up, I don't know whether or not the buffer is even big enough at the moment, also when I try to scroll it just scrolls through my last commands.
