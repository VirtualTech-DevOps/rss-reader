I have been using `zsh` for quite a bit of time. But recently I switched to using `starship` and realized that one of the things I use the most, the `transient prompt` isn't available for zsh(due to bugs & edge cases).

Also, I hate the syntax of `shell scripts`(in general) as they look alien, they don't have proper syntax highlighting(in most cases) and is generally hard to read/debug and in most cases I can't find good example codes to see.

So, I am looking for something that has a better syntax(closer to actual programming languages), has plugin support and is generally easier to customize.

I have checked out `fish`, it seemed to have all the things I need(at least at a glance). So, Should I switch to fish?
