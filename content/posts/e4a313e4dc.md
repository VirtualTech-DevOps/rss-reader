I’ve recently built _CREV_, a Go-based CLI tool designed to easily export your codebase into llms such as ChatGPT. The idea came from my frustration with manually copying code into ChatGPT or Claude to get feedback on my projects. Although ChatGPT could provide me with useful suggestions, it lacked the full context of my project, which often resulted in incomplete reviews since it didn’t know my entire directory structure and the content of all the files. I wanted to fix that, while also eliminating the constant switching between VSCode and my browser.

So after a month of development, I’m excited to share _CREV_:

*   **GitHub**: [https://github.com/vossenwout/crev](https://github.com/vossenwout/crev)
*   **Website**: [https://crevcli.com/](https://crevcli.com/)
*   **Video how I built it**: [https://youtu.be/XlHmhGL88I8](https://youtu.be/XlHmhGL88I8)

I have written the CREV CLI tool in Go as I was interested in learning the language and I heard many good things about it’s efficiency and speed. I used [https://github.com/spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to manage the CLI commands and [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for handling configurations. This is the first project I have done with Go but I find the language interesting and the Go routines also help with reading in your entire codebase. For the code reviews themselves I use google cloud functions which invoke GPT-4o (am also planning to add Claude 3.5 and GPT-o1).
