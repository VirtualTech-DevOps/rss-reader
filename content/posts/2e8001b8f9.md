I need a regex for sed that will replace all periods in a string with dashes _except for the last one_ in the string. This is for a script that I'm using to clean up a list of filenames. Some of the filenames will have periods throughout that I want replaced except for the last one which I presume will be the file's extension. Obviously, "s/./-/g" will not work for me since that will replace all the periods. How do I do something along those lines while leaving the last period intact?
