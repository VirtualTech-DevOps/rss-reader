In short, I use in a daily basis [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) and the most important thing for me are the Workflows. But Alfred Workflows does not interact well with my command-line itens. Mostly, my code editor. Besides the fact that I replace most of Alfred actions with `bash scripts`, one problem remains persistent. I will explain here:

In alfred workflows, I can create a output format in `.json` and these itens go directly to the command pallete of the software. At this point, I can select the desirable item in the list and according to some keys, for example: `ctrl`, `shift`, `opt` (or combinations `ctrl+opt+shift`) I select an action (action := run another process).

Is there any command line workflow (TUI) that does the same thing? As I said, basically I need three things:

*   Create a list of outputs to be selected.
*   Show this list at the terminal and select interact with the itens (TUI).
*   Based on keys combinations, take some further action with the selected item.

One example for this would be the the [papis](https://github.com/papis/papis) bibliography manager, where you can search the bibliography in real time in a database.
