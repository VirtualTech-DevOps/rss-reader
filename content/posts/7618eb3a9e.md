Hello all,

I am a complete beginner to CLI and I'm struggling to use the grep command the way I want to...

[https://preview.redd.it/mkr2jzp77g5e1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=f60fca4aa271199fea2068c71aa163b902ef15ed](https://preview.redd.it/mkr2jzp77g5e1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=f60fca4aa271199fea2068c71aa163b902ef15ed)

So in this case I want to find words beginning with "h" regardless of case.

So I do:

grep -i ^h Test.txt

However, the result only turns up "Hello" and not "Hazelton". Obviously there is a space before it but I want to ignore that. I've been through the manual but can't find an answer. I feel like I'm probably missing something basic here...

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
