Hey Guys recently... I went into ricing stuff and found out about icons, i am note sure how to copy those icons. because i cant find a cheat sheet like nerd fonts, and i am confused how to use them, i used gucharmap but it didnt had a search glyph option?

How do you guys use material or feather icons??
