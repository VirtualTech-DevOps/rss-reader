👋 Hey everyone!

I’m happy to share a new Node.js tool I’ve been working on, called **Zip-Stream-CLI**! 🚀

What does it do?
----------------

Zip-Stream-CLI allows you to stream, extract, and display the contents of a remote ZIP file directly in your terminal—without downloading the entire archive! 📦 It supports multiple file types, including:

*   📄 **Text files** (like `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`)
*   🎶 **Audio files** with live waveform display (like `.mp3`, `.wav`)
*   🖼️ **Images** as pixel art (like `.png`, `.jpg`)
*   📚 **PDF files** and **spreadsheets** (like `.pdf`, `.xls`)
*   💻 **Code files** with syntax highlighting (like `.js`, `.py`)
*   And many more, including archives like `.tar`, `.gz`.

Why did I create it?
--------------------

I wanted a fast and efficient way to preview the contents of ZIP files directly from the terminal, especially when dealing with large archives. Instead of extracting the entire file, you can stream specific files and view them instantly in a visually appropriate format.

Features:
---------

*   **Stream content**: Extract and display content progressively, perfect for large audio files and images. 📊
*   **Modular handler system**: Add custom handlers to support new file types. 🛠️
*   **Lightweight**: No need to install heavy desktop apps—everything is done via the command line. 💻

How it works:
-------------

Simply provide a remote URL to a ZIP file, and the CLI tool will list its contents. You can choose a file to stream or view directly in your terminal. 🖥️

Example usage: `bash zip-stream-cli https://example.com/my-archive.zip`

You can also extend the tool by adding custom handlers for any file type that isn’t already supported!

Why you might find it useful:
-----------------------------

If you work with ZIP files often, this tool can save you time by allowing you to quickly preview the content without extracting everything.
