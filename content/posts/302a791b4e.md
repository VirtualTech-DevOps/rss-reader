Is it possible for use fzf but have certain results preferred? E.g. When I type zshrc, it shows the one in /etc first before the one in my `$HOME`. I still want both results shown, but the one in `$HOME` on top _without_ additional search string to narrow it down to the one in `$HOME`. I prefer everything on `$HOME` to be shown first.
