Hi there everyone. This post is to address [a discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1fmq6g8/rant_unixporn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) from earlier today and start a discussion about what the unixporn mod team and our community as a whole can do to improve things.

First off: we wholeheartedly agree with the points raised in the linked thread. To put it simply, unique posts in unixporn have become few and far between, with most following the same formula of 1. only using transparent terminal window(s) and 2. only using premade themes. I feel that the vast majority of people, mod team included, want the rules to be changed to limit these kinds of posts and require some kind of deviation from the norm.

However, this is easier said than done -- previous members of the mod team enforced a much stricter criteria for what makes a post "non-default", resulting in a large portion of users becoming upset because their posts were being removed. The mod team decided to relax the rules surrounding default posts to try and make unixporn a more welcoming place, which has ultimately led to our current situation. So, here are our proposed changes:

1.  Make the rules for busy screenshots stricter by requiring that at least two different applications are visible (e.g. terminal and file manager, web browser and image browser). They must be different apps, so it can't just be two terminals -- this is to try and make posts more visually interesting and require more effort to make. We want to see how you _really_ use your system.
2.  More strictly enforce the no defaults rule by removing posts that only use premade themes. This includes many Windows and macOS lookalikes and popular color schemes (as most of these are purely made by installing premade configs and themes).

These changes, of course, are not set in stone and are not meant to be enforced to the letter. There may be exceptions for great rices -- it's really about the spirit of the rules: to encourage the creation of unique rices, not remove them.

What do you all think?
