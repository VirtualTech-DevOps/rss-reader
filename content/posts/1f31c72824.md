this would be quite useful when wanting to paste a bunch of links in the terminal (using right click) without having to have my hand on the keyboard to manually space after each link

i'm not sure if this is possible directly in the shell config or should i make a terminal emulator shortcut for it, i'm using bash, zsh and fish (on cygwin), the hyper terminal emulator on windows 10
