I'm trying to brainstorm a solution for a way to capture history locally across multiple remote sessions for multiple accounts. Basically I want a .bash\_history file for me, the human, not my various accounts across systems. I tried doing something with a local keylogger, but in addition to capturing passwords, the output there is not very useful:

    cd /h[TAB]m[TAB]bi[TAB][^A][DEL][DEL]ll[^M] 

Example scenario: I need to run a diagnostic command as user1@server1 and upload the results to the vendor via my browser.

*   Log into the server, su to user1, `diag.sh > ~/output1`
*   su to root, `cp /home/user1/output1 /home/me/`
*   `chown me:me /home/me/output1`
*   Back to my local machine and `scp me@server1:output1 .`
*   Then upload the file, which isn't a CLI thing.

I'd love some way to have a local file with the following contents:

    [2024-10-15 17:30:57] me@localhost ssh me@server1 [2024-10-15 17:31:02] me@server1 sudo -iu user1 [2024-10-25 17:31:05] user1@server1 diag.sh > ~/output1 [2024-10-25 17:32:18] user1@server1 exit [2024-10-15 17:32:20] me@server1 sudo su - [2024-10-15 17:32:23] root@server1 cp /home/user1/output1 /home/me/ [2024-10-15 17:32:26] root@server1 chown me:me /home/me/output1 [2024-10-15 17:32:28] root@server1 exit [2024-10-15 17:32:44] me@localhost scp me@server1:output 1 .
