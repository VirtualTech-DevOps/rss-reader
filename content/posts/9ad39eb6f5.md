[![[KDE PLASMA 6] Finally switched to linux and didn’t compromise anything. First rice btw.](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IAjfudSjzDxmwT2OFm93WKq4huAkXpuIwWt0DgpdaKc.jpg "[KDE PLASMA 6] Finally switched to linux and didn’t compromise anything.

Over the years I have found myself often switching to linux but never staying on it for regular use and going back to windows because I couldn’t get things to work.

Now with better knowledge I prepared a list for all my apps and their FOSS alternatives etc., got my “required” windows apps to run through winapps, and installed the game I often play and wow I cannot go back to windows, the battery life is so much better!

Also my system would for some reason heat when charging and throttle to 0.4ghz on windows but here on Fedora KDE no such issues!

So happy to finally be able to post on this sub and be a part of the community! <3
