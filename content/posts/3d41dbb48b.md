I'm encountering a strange issue with Mobaxterm's pasting functionality after rebinding the paste command. I wanted to change the default _Ctrl + Shift + Insert_ to _Ctrl + V_ to make pasting quicker and more intuitive. However, when I try to paste using the new keybind, my CopyQ clipboard manager opens, but nothing actually pastes from it. The same thing happens when I try to use the Windows clipboard. (and its really annoying because I like using the clipboard for pasting sometimes)

To clarify, the Windows clipboard integration hasn’t worked at all, not even with the default settings. I’ve seen suggestions to right-click to paste or simply stick to _Ctrl + Shift + Insert_, but as a keyboard-focused user, that’s not an ideal workaround. I work with frequent copy-paste actions, so constantly reaching for the mouse would disrupt my workflow and slow me down.

If Mobaxterm doesn't support custom rebinding for pasting from CopyQ or the Windows clipboard, I might need to explore alternative tools. If anyone has encountered this or found a workaround—or if there’s another terminal tool that supports more flexible key bindings—I'd love to hear your suggestions.

FYI I tried ditto clipboard manager, But it was not able to paste from the clipboard, even with the default settings of mobaxterm, without rebinding anything.
