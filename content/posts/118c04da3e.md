[![[Xfce] I have committed the worst kind of blasphemy.](https://preview.redd.it/fl35u12kqfpd1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=dbbd54d167c167b289ba73c465ac452bf6e2eeea "[Xfce] I have committed the worst kind of blasphemy.")](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1fjb0jm/xfce_i_have_committed_the_worst_kind_of_blasphemy/)

Theme: Chicago95 (icons, cursors, & GTK+) Fonts: MS Sans Serif Regular & More Perfect DOS VGA Regular

Not pictured is my LightDM greeter. I'm using the Webkit2 Greeter, with the Chicago95 theme.

I'm still trying to figure out how to get Plymouth to work. I've set my mkinitcpio hooks correctly (I think. systemd before plymouth), but I'm still getting the wall of text boot and shutdown. Oh, well... That's a tomorrow problem.
