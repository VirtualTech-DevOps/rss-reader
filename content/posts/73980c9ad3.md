I learn by doing guided exercises for example: textbook. However, I could not find any exercises for awk. Since awk probably can only clean data, I am looking for data cleaning projects (that can be in SQL, excel or anything else) and I'll do it in awk. This is purely to learn awk and nothing professional.
