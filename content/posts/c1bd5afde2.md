Was looking through my `.bashrc` and found this  
`alias gname='curl -s https://frightanic.com/goodies_content/docker-names.php'` It just generates a name using docker's algorithm for container names, i.e. dreamy\_liskov, cranky\_hoover, gloomy\_kare, etc.

P.S.  
Don't remember where it came from, but probably I was planning to use it as a random nickname generator. Yeah it's not a standalone app and uses online resource, but still.
