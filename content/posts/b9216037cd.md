I've installed zoxide as an apt package on a fresh ubuntu install, version 0.9.3, in Bash.  
I have the required:

`eval "$(zoxide init bash)"`

In the .bashrc.  
The question is the history is not building correctly on its own. An example:

I can add a directory manually with zoxide add, but it's very inconvenient, kind of messes up the main strength of the tool.

Any help will be much appreciated, thanks in advance
