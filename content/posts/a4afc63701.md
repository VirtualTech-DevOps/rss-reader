`thqm` is a command line tool that creates and serves a dynamic web page menu directly from your terminal. It’s like `dmenu`/`rofi`, but served as a web page that can be accessed across your local network, making it perfect for controlling scripts remotely.

### Usage

`thqm` will generate a web page based on the provided `stdin`, the selected entry will be printed to `stdout`.

A typical script will look something like this:

\`\`\`bash

!/bin/sh
========

define the handler function, i.e. what each option should do.
=============================================================

handler() { while IFS= read -r event; do case "$event" in "Option 1") # handle Option 1 ;; "Option 2") # handle Option 2 ;; \*) # pass through thqm's output echo "$event" ;; esac done }

printf "Option 1\\nOption 2" | thqm "$@" | handler

^ ^ ^ Pass user selections to the handler
=========================================

│ └ Forward script's options to thqm
====================================

└ Provide the options to thqm through stdin
===========================================
