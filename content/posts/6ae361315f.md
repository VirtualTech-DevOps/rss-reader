[LINK TO `plock` CODE ON GITHUB](https://github.com/jkool702/misc-public-scripts/blob/main/plock.bash)

`plock` is a bash function that implements locking very efficiently. It serves the same function as `flock`, though it isnt quite a drop-in replacement. However, `plock` is 5-10x faster (both in wall clock time and CPU time) than `flock` - on my system it can acquire and release a lock in a combined total of ~140 microseconds.

This makes it an ideal choice for situations where you need to acquire and release a lock repeatedly in rapid succession. An example of this might be having multiple process output to a file and using `plock` to ensure only 1 writes at a time (to ensure writes are atomic). One real-life example of this sort of usage is in my [forkrun](https://github.com/jkool702/forkrun) utility for running code in parallel where plock is used\* to manage parallel i/o to a tmpfile containing inputs to run.

\\ok, the plock function isnt actually used, but the methodology that plock uses _is_ used. I figured out how to do pipe-based locking explicitly for use in forkrun. plock came afterwords with the intent of expanding the locking method that forkrun uses into a general-use locking function.)

USAGE
-----

Usage is very simple, and is very close to the `flock $fd` style of locking.

    # source the plock function . /path/to/plock.bash # get lock plock # do stuff holding exclusive lock # release lock plock -u 

Running plock will set a few variables in your shell: `PLOCK_ID`, `PLOCK_FD` and `PLOCK_HAVELOCK`. If you want to "join" into another existing lock, grab the `PLOCK_ID` from that process and then use

    plock -p $PLOCK_ID 

to share the lock with the process. This allows one to have a single lock shared between multiple processes, where each will automatically queue up and efficiently wait for the lock.

HOW IT WORKS
------------

When `plock` is first called, it opens an anonymous pipe at file desriptor $PLOCK\_FD and writes a single newline to it.

    exec {PLOCK_FD}<><(:) 

If, instead, you are joining in an existing lock, `plock` searches procfs for the `PLOCK_ID` that you passed on the `plock` commandline. When it finds it (at `/proc/<...>`) it then instead runs

    exec {PLOCK_FD}<>/proc/<...> 

To aquire the lock, a process runs

    read -r -n 1 -u $PLOCK_FD 

which will consume the lone newline in the anonymous pipe's pipe buffer.

To release a lock, the process writes a newline back to the pipe

    printf '\n' >&${PLOCK_FD} 

When a process tries to aquire a lock that another process already has, there will be nothing in the pipe buffer and the read command will block. When the lock is released a newline is added to the pipe and the process waiting for the lock will aquire it instantly - no need for any sort of polling (i.e., repeatedly trying to aquire the lock, with a brief pause in between attempts). If multiple processes are waiting for the lock they will automatically be queued up. These aspects are all natively handled by the kernel's pipe/FIFO handling routines, and are handled very efficiently.
