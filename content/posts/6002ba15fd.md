    sudo dd if=/dev/sdc conv=sync,noerror status=progress | gzip -c ssd_backup.img.gz 

OS: SteamOS 3.5.19 (Valve's Arch Linux derivative for Steam Deck)

Running the `dd` command on its own with the `status=progress` argument causes it to display progress information in the Terminal. Am I correct in assuming that if I ran the above command, that progress information would actually get sent to the gzip command, alongside the /dev/sdc sector data, resulting in a ssd\_backup.img.gz that is useless?

Extra detail of what I'm trying to accomplish:
----------------------------------------------

I need to copy data between disks to free up 1 TB of storage space on one drive, for a one day project. I'm trying to copy data from an external 2 TB APFS-formatted SSD to an image file on my Steam Deck's largely empty internal 2 TB SSD. APFS is a proprietary macOS file system that the Steam Deck doesn't understand, so I am using `dd` to do a raw sector-by-sector cloning of the entire disk. Clearly, for that to have any chance of fitting on the destination, I need to use compression. But I would also like to have some visual indicator of the progress, instead of just waiting blindly for the command to complete.

If you know a better way to accomplish this goal, please share. I have also thought about setting up a Samba server on the Steam Deck so that I could copy files and directories instead of raw sectors, but I figure USB 3.0 should be faster than Gigabit Ethernet.
