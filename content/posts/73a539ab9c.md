I have recently created a program to watch anime from cli. You can stream any anime you want and the latest watched episode would be updated on anilist. You can have Discord RPC showing what anime you are watching with anime cover. You can also skip the Intro and Outro of the anime with this program. The playback speed of your player would also be saved so you dont have to change the speed for each episode. I would be adding new features to this program very soon. Please consider giving it a star on
