Hi all, I'd like to share my project, Scooter, which is a terminal UI app designed for quick find-and-replace while allowing you to select exactly which instances you want to replace. If any files change between selection and replacement, affected instances won't be changed and you'll see these as errors at the end. It works with capture groups too, and respects .gitignore and .ignore files. I'd love any feedback!
