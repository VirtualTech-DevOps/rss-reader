So I’m kinda in my FAANG ditching arc right now and this whole thing with unix customizations became a revelation for me a week ago. I guess this is how I’m gonna live from now on.

All of this is fun but I wonder why isn’t there a such thing as DotHub? I imagine everyone could upload their configs with a resulting screenshot. Each config affects one app, but you can also create pack of configs. Configs can also have some prerequisites performed automatically. We will also need a web page showcasing the hub allowing users to explore configs and packs of configs, filtering them by program, environment etc.

I mean it’s not even hard to do, I can manage it. But maybe I’m missing something? Is there something I don’t see? Would love to know what you guys think about it.
